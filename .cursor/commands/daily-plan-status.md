# Daily Plan Status Command

Execute the system daily planning CLI to show today's daily plan status.

## Instructions for Claude:

Execute the existing system CLI tool: `.claudedirector/tools/bin/daily-plan status`

## Expected Behavior:

- Direct CLI execution without code generation
- Show today's plan if it exists from SQLite database
- Display priorities and strategic balance
- Show "No plan created" message if none exists
- Suggest using daily-plan commands to create a plan

## Architecture Compliance:

- ✅ PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md: Uses existing system tool in .claudedirector/tools/bin/
- ✅ BLOAT_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md: No code duplication, calls existing implementation
- ✅ Native execution: Direct CLI call, no Python code generation required
