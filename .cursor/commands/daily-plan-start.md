# Daily Plan Start Command

Execute the system daily planning CLI to start interactive daily planning.

## Instructions for Claude:

Execute the existing system CLI tool: `.claudedirector/tools/bin/daily-plan start`

## Expected Behavior:

- Direct CLI execution without code generation
- Start interactive planning session
- Collect user priorities and strategic focus
- Assess L0/L1 strategic balance
- Save plan with timestamp to SQLite database
- Confirm successful plan creation

## Architecture Compliance:

- ✅ PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md: Uses existing system tool in .claudedirector/tools/bin/
- ✅ BLOAT_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md: No code duplication, calls existing implementation
- ✅ Native execution: Direct CLI call, no Python code generation required
