# Import Fix Analysis

## Current Status
- All 21 business-critical tests are PASSING on main branch
- Core module imports are working correctly
- Package structure appears to be functional

## Pre-Push Sanity Check Implementation
Added comprehensive sanity check to prevent future architectural bloat:

### Thresholds
- **Max Additions**: 5,000 lines (prevents massive code dumps)
- **Max Files**: 50 files (encourages focused changes)
- **Deletion Ratio**: 10% minimum for large additions (prevents pure duplication)

### Safeguards
- Detects code duplication patterns
- Warns on excessive file changes
- Validates healthy refactoring ratios
- Provides bypass option for legitimate large changes

## Lesson Learned
The original 46K addition was a clear sign of architectural bloat rather than proper refactoring.
This sanity check will prevent similar issues in the future.
