## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Delivery Risks:**
- **Experience Services resource constraint** → Platform scaling timeline at risk → Escalating senior backend engineer hire approval for Q4
- **Cross-team API standardization** → Integration delays potential → Implementing dedicated API governance working group
- **Globalization legal review bottleneck** → Market expansion timeline pressure → Engaging external legal counsel for parallel review

**Resource Implications:**
- **Critical need:** Senior Experience Services engineer for Q4 platform scaling ($165K investment, 8-month ROI through reduced integration overhead)
- **Infrastructure scaling:** Additional $22K/month for multi-region deployment capabilities (self-funding through operational efficiency)

**Cross-Team Dependencies:**
- **Platform Architecture coordination:** 3 weeks required for service mesh integration, resource allocation negotiated
- **Legal team capacity:** International compliance review needed, external counsel engagement approved
- **Product alignment:** Market expansion priorities confirmed with VP Product, resource reallocation approved

**Questions for SLT Discussion:**
1. **Platform scaling timeline:** Should we accelerate Experience Services hiring to capture Q4 scaling opportunity, or maintain current timeline with adjusted scope expectations?
2. **Market expansion investment:** Given 28% user activation improvements, should we increase globalization investment budget to accelerate international market entry timeline?
3. **Cross-team coordination model:** Platform Architecture dependency management - should we establish dedicated coordination capacity or continue project-based allocation?
