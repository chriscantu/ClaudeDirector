### 🎯 **How It Works: Strategic Personas + Domain Intelligence**

**Two-Layer Intelligence System:**

1. **Strategic Personas** (Your Core Team):
   - **Rachel, Martin, Alvaro, Diego, Camille** - Your original strategic leadership team
   - **Director-level expertise**: Organizational strategy, business impact, technical governance
   - **Preserved exactly as you configured them** for your specific needs

2. **Domain Context Analysis**:
   - **Analyzes your conversation** to understand the engineering domain (mobile, platform, etc.)
   - **Routes to the right strategic persona** based on the type of leadership challenge
   - **Maintains your original personas** while adding intelligent domain routing

**Example Flow:**
```
👤 "Our mobile platform needs better cross-team governance"
🔍 Domain Analysis: Mobile + Organizational Strategy
🎯 Routes to: Rachel (UX Strategy) - for cross-functional alignment expertise
🤖 Rachel: "Let's design a governance framework for mobile platform alignment..."
```

### 🎚️ **Organic Activation Controls**
**Feel natural while staying responsive:**

- **High Confidence (≥80%)**: Director activates immediately, seamlessly
- **Medium Confidence (60-80%)**: Gentle suggestion, easy to accept/decline
- **Low Confidence (<60%)**: Shows multiple director options to choose from
- **Anti-thrashing protection**: Prevents unnecessary director switching

**Tune your experience:**
```bash
# More responsive switching for power users
claudedirector personas tune --sensitivity high

# More stable experience for focused conversations
claudedirector personas tune --sensitivity low

# Quick overrides: @marcus, @rachel, @auto
```
