## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** to your Claude Code configuration directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> ~/.claude
   ```

2. **Verify file structure**:
   ```
   ~/.claude/
   ├── CLAUDE.md          # Entry point and UI Foundation context
   ├── PERSONAS.md        # Strategic leadership persona system
   ├── COMMANDS.md        # Command execution framework
   ├── FLAGS.md           # Flag system reference
   ├── ORCHESTRATOR.md    # Intelligent routing system
   ├── MCP.md             # MCP server integration
   ├── MODES.md           # Operational modes
   ├── PRINCIPLES.md      # Development principles
   └── RULES.md           # Operational rules
   ```

3. **Customize context** in CLAUDE.md:
   - Update UI Foundation context for your specific platform organization
   - Modify stakeholder relationships and success metrics
   - Adjust strategic priorities and organizational challenges

## Usage Examples

### Director-Level Strategic Commands

#### Organizational Assessment
```bash
/assess-org organization --focus performance --timeframe quarterly
# Comprehensive team performance and cultural health analysis
```

#### Executive Communication
```bash
/prepare-slt technology-strategy --format presentation --audience slt
# VP/SLT technology strategy presentation with business focus
```

#### Cross-Functional Coordination
```bash
/align-stakeholders platform-strategy --stakeholders "product,design,executive"
# Strategic stakeholder alignment for platform initiatives
```

#### Investment Justification
```bash
/justify-investment platform-capability --amount "1-2M" --stakeholders executive
# Strategic business case development with ROI analysis
```

### Strategic Analysis & Planning
```bash
/analyze --focus platform-strategy --persona-diego
# Platform investment analysis with cross-team impact assessment

/design --scope system --stakeholders "engineering,product" --persona-martin
# System architecture strategy with organizational alignment

/improve --organizational-capability --persona-camille
# Organizational development and platform governance optimization
```

### IC-Level Task Delegation
```bash
# Development tasks delegated to sub-agents
/task "Build and deploy platform component" --persona-devops --delegate auto
/task "Implement design system component" --persona-frontend --delegate files

# Analysis tasks delegated to specialists  
/task "Debug cross-team integration issue" --persona-analyzer --focus root-cause
/task "Security assessment of authentication flow" --persona-security --validate
```

## Customization

### Adapting for Your Organization
1. **Update UI Foundation Context** in CLAUDE.md with your specific:
   - Platform capabilities and technology stack
   - Team structure and reporting relationships
   - Stakeholder names and organizational structure
   - Success metrics and strategic priorities

2. **Customize Personas** in PERSONAS.md:
   - Add company-specific context to persona backgrounds
   - Update MCP server preferences based on your tooling
   - Modify auto-activation triggers for your environment

3. **Extend Meeting Workflows**:
   - Add meeting types specific to your organization
   - Customize prep workflows for your stakeholder relationships
   - Update persona activation patterns for your context

### Adding New Capabilities
- **New Personas**: Follow the established pattern in PERSONAS.md
- **Custom Commands**: Extend COMMANDS.md with organization-specific workflows
- **Additional Flags**: Add domain-specific flags to FLAGS.md
- **Integration Points**: Update MCP.md for your specific tooling ecosystem

## Best Practices

### Getting Started
1. **Start with Tier 1 Personas**: Focus on camille, diego, alvaro for executive-level strategic guidance
2. **Use Director Commands**: Begin with `/assess-org`, `/prepare-slt`, `/align-stakeholders` for immediate impact
3. **Delegate IC Tasks**: Use `/task` command for hands-on technical work with specialized sub-agents
4. **Leverage Meeting Workflows**: Context-aware preparation for executive communications

### Advanced Usage
- **Multi-Tier Collaboration**: Combine Tier 1 + Tier 2 personas for comprehensive strategic initiatives
- **Sub-Agent Orchestration**: Efficient delegation of operational tasks while maintaining strategic oversight
- **Wave Mode Integration**: Leverage wave orchestration for complex organizational transformations
- **Strategic Scenario Planning**: Use advanced persona combinations for VP/SLT decision making
