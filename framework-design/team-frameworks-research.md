## üèóÔ∏è **Team Topologies Framework**

### **Core Principles**
1. **Conway's Law**: Team structure determines architecture
2. **Cognitive Load Management**: Teams have limited cognitive capacity
3. **Team-First Thinking**: Design organization around team effectiveness
4. **Fast Flow**: Optimize for continuous value delivery

### **Four Team Types**

#### **1. üåä Stream-Aligned Team**
- **Purpose**: Deliver continuous value for specific business domain
- **Characteristics**: End-to-end ownership, cross-functional, autonomous
- **Size**: 5-9 people (cognitive load limit)
- **Skills**: Full stack capabilities aligned to domain

#### **2. üõ†Ô∏è Platform Team**
- **Purpose**: Provide internal services to accelerate stream-aligned teams
- **Characteristics**: Self-service platforms, developer experience focus
- **Relationship**: "Platform as a product" mindset
- **Skills**: Infrastructure, tooling, developer experience

#### **3. üéØ Enabling Team**
- **Purpose**: Help stream-aligned teams overcome obstacles and gaps
- **Characteristics**: Temporary assistance, capability building
- **Relationship**: Mentoring and knowledge transfer
- **Skills**: Specialized expertise, teaching, coaching

#### **4. üî¨ Complicated Subsystem Team**
- **Purpose**: Manage complex subsystems requiring specialized knowledge
- **Characteristics**: Deep technical expertise, high complexity domains
- **Relationship**: Reduces cognitive load for other teams
- **Skills**: Domain-specific expertise, complex system management

### **Three Interaction Modes**

#### **1. ü§ù Collaboration**
- **When**: Discovery, innovation, complex problem solving
- **Duration**: Temporary (weeks to months)
- **Outcome**: New solutions, shared understanding

#### **2. üì¶ X-as-a-Service**
- **When**: Stable, well-defined services
- **Duration**: Ongoing
- **Outcome**: Clear API contracts, service consumption

#### **3. üéì Facilitating**
- **When**: Capability gaps, new technology adoption
- **Duration**: Temporary (until capability is built)
- **Outcome**: Enhanced team capabilities, knowledge transfer

## ‚ö° **Accelerate Framework (DORA Research)**

### **Core Principles**
1. **Psychological Safety**: Foundation for high performance
2. **Continuous Learning**: Culture of experimentation and improvement
3. **Customer Focus**: Outcomes over outputs
4. **Small Batch Delivery**: Frequent, small deployments

### **Four Key Metrics (DORA)**

#### **1. üìà Deployment Frequency**
- **Elite**: Multiple times per day
- **High**: Between once per day and once per week
- **Medium**: Between once per week and once per month
- **Low**: Less than once per month

#### **2. ‚è±Ô∏è Lead Time for Changes**
- **Elite**: Less than one hour
- **High**: Between one day and one week
- **Medium**: Between one week and one month
- **Low**: More than one month

#### **3. üîÑ Change Failure Rate**
- **Elite**: 0-15%
- **High**: 16-30%
- **Medium**: 31-45%
- **Low**: 46-60%

#### **4. üöÄ Recovery Time**
- **Elite**: Less than one hour
- **High**: Less than one day
- **Medium**: Between one day and one week
- **Low**: More than one week

### **Team Performance Capabilities**

#### **Technical Capabilities**
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**
- **Test Automation**
- **Trunk-based Development**
- **Shift Left on Security**
- **Monitoring and Observability**

#### **Management Capabilities**
- **Lean Product Development**
- **Team Empowerment**
- **Clear Change Process**
- **Proactive Monitoring**

#### **Cultural Capabilities**
- **Psychological Safety**
- **Learning Culture**
- **Customer Collaboration**
- **Job Satisfaction**

### **Team Composition Guidelines**

#### **High-Performing Team Characteristics**
- **Small and Autonomous**: 5-9 people optimal
- **Cross-Functional**: All skills needed for end-to-end delivery
- **Stable**: Low team churn, long-term collaboration
- **Empowered**: Decision-making authority
- **Customer-Connected**: Direct feedback loops

#### **Skill Mix Optimization**
- **T-Shaped Skills**: Broad knowledge, deep specialization
- **Psychological Safety**: Trust, learning from failures
- **Continuous Learning**: Dedicated time for skill development
- **Diversity**: Cognitive diversity for better problem solving

## üöÄ **Implementation Approach**

### **Framework 1: Team Topologies**
1. **Team Type Assessment**: Identify current and optimal team types
2. **Interaction Mode Design**: Define team interaction patterns
3. **Conway's Law Analysis**: Align team structure with desired architecture
4. **Cognitive Load Evaluation**: Assess and optimize team complexity
5. **Evolution Strategy**: Plan team structure changes over time

### **Framework 2: Accelerate Performance**
1. **DORA Metrics Assessment**: Current performance measurement
2. **Capability Gap Analysis**: Technical, management, cultural gaps
3. **Team Composition Optimization**: Size, skills, autonomy
4. **Performance Improvement Planning**: Systematic capability building
5. **Culture Development**: Psychological safety and learning culture
