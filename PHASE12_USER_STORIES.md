## ðŸ“‹ **Document Purpose**

**ðŸ“š Strategic Framework: Jobs-to-be-Done detected**
---
**Framework Attribution**: This analysis applies Jobs-to-be-Done methodology for user story development, adapted through my Platform Architecture experience with MCP Sequential enhancement.

User stories for Phase 12 Always-On MCP Enhancement, focusing on the transformation from inconsistent threshold-based enhancement (40-60% rate) to guaranteed 100% enterprise-grade AI consistency.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Epic: Always-On MCP Enhancement**

**Epic Statement**: As a strategic leader, I want ClaudeDirector to provide consistent, predictable, enterprise-grade AI enhancement for every interaction, so that I can rely on professional-level strategic guidance without worrying about whether my query will trigger AI enhancement.

**Business Justification**: Eliminates user confusion and frustration from inconsistent AI enhancement, positioning ClaudeDirector as the first "always excellent" AI strategic leadership platform.
