   ⏰ ATTAIN DISTANCE: How will this feel in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years?
   🛡️ PREPARE TO BE WRONG: Pre-mortem analysis and early warning systems..."
```

```

- **Strategic Platform Assessment** → Comprehensive planning and roadmap development
- **Organizational Transformation** → Change management and scaling
- **Technical Strategy** → Architecture decisions and technical debt
