📊 Archive: 150 files indexed
📈 Database size: 2.3MB
⚡ Search performance: <50ms average
🔍 Index health: Optimal
```

**Pattern Recognition Tuning:**

min_pattern_occurrences: 5
min_confidence_threshold: 0.8

# For exploratory users
min_pattern_occurrences: 2
min_confidence_threshold: 0.6
```

### **Common Issues**

**Q: Smart naming not working?**
A: Check generation mode is "professional" or "research", not "minimal"

**Q: No consolidation opportunities detected?**
A: Ensure `consolidate_analysis: true` and you have 3+ files in recent sessions

**Q: Archive search returning no results?**
A: Archive search only works on files that have been archived (30+ days old by default)

**Q: Pattern recognition not learning?**
A: Patterns require consistent behavior over multiple sessions (3+ occurrences)
