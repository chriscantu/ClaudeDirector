## 🎯 **"Good Strategy Bad Strategy" (Richard Rumelt)**

### **Strategy Kernel Framework**

**When it activates:** Strategy development, strategic planning, addressing "fluff" in current strategies

**The Three-Part Kernel:**

#### **1. 🔍 Strategic Diagnosis**
- **Identifies the true nature of the challenge** you're facing
- **Pinpoints critical obstacles** and constraints
- **Uncovers strategic insights** others might miss

**Example Questions:**
- "What is the real challenge behind this strategic issue?"
- "What are the critical bottlenecks we must overcome?"
- "What insights give us potential competitive advantage?"

#### **2. 📋 Guiding Policy**
- **Defines your overall approach** to overcome the challenge
- **Makes explicit choices** about what you will NOT do
- **Creates strategic advantage** through focus and coherence

**Example Questions:**
- "What overall approach will overcome this challenge?"
- "What will we explicitly choose NOT to do?"
- "How does this policy create competitive advantage?"

#### **3. ⚡ Coherent Action**
- **Designs specific actions** that implement the guiding policy
- **Ensures actions reinforce each other** rather than work at cross-purposes
- **Focuses resources** on areas of strategic advantage

**Example Questions:**
- "What specific actions will implement our policy?"
- "How do these actions reinforce each other?"
- "What resources and capabilities do we need?"

### **Bad Strategy Detection**

**Automatically identifies and helps you avoid:**

- **🚫 Fluff**: Vague language that sounds profound but says nothing
- **🚫 Failure to Face the Challenge**: Not identifying real obstacles
- **🚫 Mistaking Goals for Strategy**: Wishful thinking without method
- **🚫 Bad Strategic Objectives**: Impossible or impractical goals
