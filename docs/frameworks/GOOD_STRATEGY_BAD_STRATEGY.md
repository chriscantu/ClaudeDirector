# Good Strategy Bad Strategy Framework

**Richard Rumelt's Strategy Kernel Framework for developing powerful strategic guidance.**

---

## üéØ **Framework Overview**

**Source**: "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt
**Application**: Strategy development, strategic planning, addressing "fluff" in current strategies
**Persona Alignment**: Primarily Camille (Strategic Technology), Diego (Engineering Leadership)

### **When This Framework Activates**
- Strategic planning discussions
- Competitive positioning questions
- Platform strategy development
- Executive strategy communication
- Strategic decision evaluation

## üìã **The Strategy Kernel Framework**

### **Core Principle**
Good strategy is not aspirational fluff or a list of goals. It is a coherent response to an important challenge that includes three essential elements working together.

### **The Three-Part Kernel**

#### **1. üîç Strategic Diagnosis**
**Purpose**: Identifies the true nature of the challenge you're facing

**Key Elements**:
- **Pinpoints critical obstacles** and constraints that must be overcome
- **Uncovers strategic insights** that others might miss or ignore
- **Simplifies complex situations** into understandable core challenges
- **Identifies sources of power** and advantage within constraints

**Strategic Questions**:
- "What is the real challenge behind this strategic issue?"
- "What are the critical bottlenecks we must overcome?"
- "What insights give us potential competitive advantage?"
- "What's actually preventing us from succeeding?"

**Example Application**:
```
Platform Strategy Diagnosis:
"The real challenge isn't technical capabilities‚Äîit's adoption friction.
Teams avoid our platform because integration requires 3-week overhead
per project. The critical bottleneck is onboarding complexity, not
feature gaps. Our advantage lies in superior reliability, but it's
hidden behind poor developer experience."
```

#### **2. üìã Guiding Policy**
**Purpose**: Defines your overall approach to overcome the challenge

**Key Elements**:
- **Makes explicit choices** about what you will NOT do
- **Creates strategic advantage** through focus and coherence
- **Leverages insights** from the strategic diagnosis
- **Establishes boundaries** and resource allocation principles

**Strategic Questions**:
- "What overall approach will overcome this challenge?"
- "What will we explicitly choose NOT to do?"
- "How does this policy create competitive advantage?"
- "What constraints does this policy accept or reject?"

**Example Application**:
```
Platform Strategy Policy:
"We will prioritize developer experience over feature breadth. We will
NOT build every requested feature. Instead, we will focus exclusively
on reducing integration time from 3 weeks to 3 days through improved
tooling, better documentation, and automated setup. We accept slower
feature delivery to achieve superior adoption velocity."
```

#### **3. ‚ö° Coherent Action**
**Purpose**: Designs specific actions that implement the guiding policy

**Key Elements**:
- **Ensures actions reinforce each other** rather than work at cross-purposes
- **Focuses resources** on areas of strategic advantage
- **Creates momentum** through coordinated effort
- **Builds capabilities** that support the guiding policy

**Strategic Questions**:
- "What specific actions will implement our policy?"
- "How do these actions reinforce each other?"
- "What resources and capabilities do we need?"
- "Which actions have the highest strategic impact?"

**Example Application**:
```
Platform Strategy Actions:
1. Create 3-day integration bootcamp with hands-on tooling
2. Rewrite documentation with quick-start focus (not comprehensive reference)
3. Build automated project setup wizard reducing manual steps by 80%
4. Establish integration success metrics (time-to-first-value)
5. Create developer advocacy team focused on onboarding experience

These actions reinforce each other: better tooling enables faster bootcamps,
improved documentation supports automated setup, success metrics drive
continuous improvement in developer experience.
```

## üö´ **Bad Strategy Detection**

### **Four Hallmarks of Bad Strategy**
1. **Fluff**: Gibberish masquerading as strategic insight
2. **Failure to face the challenge**: Not acknowledging or defining the core strategic challenge
3. **Mistaking goals for strategy**: Listing ambitious goals without explaining how to achieve them
4. **Bad strategic objectives**: Objectives that are impracticable or don't address the central challenge

### **Warning Signs in Strategic Discussions**
- **Generic language**: "We need to be more innovative/agile/customer-focused"
- **Goal lists without methods**: "Increase adoption by 50%" without explaining how
- **Avoiding hard choices**: "We need to do everything better"
- **Buzzword heavy**: Heavy use of business jargon without specific meaning

### **Strategic Clarity Questions**
Use these to test strategy quality:
- "What specific challenge does this strategy address?"
- "What are we choosing NOT to do?"
- "How do our actions work together to create advantage?"
- "What would failure look like, and how does this strategy prevent it?"

## üéØ **Application in Engineering Leadership**

### **Platform Strategy Development**
```
Diagnosis: "Our platform suffers from low adoption despite superior technical capabilities."

Policy: "Focus entirely on developer experience over feature expansion."

Actions:
- Rebuild onboarding to achieve <1 week integration
- Create dedicated DX team with adoption metrics
- Standardize tooling across all platform services
- Implement usage analytics to measure DX improvements
```

### **Technical Debt Strategy**
```
Diagnosis: "Technical debt is slowing feature delivery and increasing bugs."

Policy: "Prioritize debt reduction in critical path systems only."

Actions:
- Map technical debt to delivery velocity impact
- Establish 20% time allocation for critical debt reduction
- Create architectural decision records to prevent debt accumulation
- Implement code health metrics with automated tracking
```

### **Team Structure Strategy**
```
Diagnosis: "Cross-team coordination overhead is limiting platform scaling."

Policy: "Minimize coordination through clear ownership boundaries."

Actions:
- Implement Team Topologies patterns with clear interfaces
- Create platform team focused on reducing cognitive load
- Establish API contracts that enable independent team development
- Build self-service capabilities reducing cross-team dependencies
```

## üìä **Framework Integration**

### **Combines Effectively With**
- **Team Topologies**: Use strategy kernel to define optimal team structure
- **WRAP Decision Framework**: Apply strategy kernel within major decision processes
- **Capital Allocation Framework**: Use strategic diagnosis to guide investment priorities
- **Technical Strategy Framework**: Apply kernel structure to technical strategic decisions

### **Persona-Specific Applications**

#### **Camille (Strategic Technology)**
