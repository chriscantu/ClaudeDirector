## ðŸ§ª **Test the Framework Detection**

### **Test in Cursor - Try These Questions:**

#### **1. Team Structure Question**
```
We need to restructure our engineering teams using Team Topologies principles with 
stream-aligned teams and platform teams to reduce cognitive load.
```
**Expected**: 
- ðŸŽ¯ Diego | Engineering Leadership
- ðŸ“š Strategic Framework: Team Topologies detected
- Confidence: ~0.70

#### **2. Strategic Decision Question**
```
Let's apply the WRAP framework to this strategic decision by widening our options, 
reality testing assumptions, and preparing to be wrong.
```
**Expected**:
- ðŸ“Š Camille | Strategic Technology
- ðŸ“š Strategic Framework: WRAP Framework detected
- Confidence: ~0.67

#### **3. Platform Strategy Question**
```
Our platform strategy should focus on network effects and ecosystem development 
to create competitive advantages.
```
**Expected**:
- ðŸ’¼ Alvaro | Platform Investment Strategy
- ðŸ“š Strategic Framework: Platform Strategy Framework detected
- Confidence: ~0.62

#### **4. Design System Question**
```
