# Persona Chat Integration

**Complete integration of P2.1 Executive Communication with natural language persona interactions.**

## Overview

The Persona Chat Integration bridges the ClaudeDirector persona framework with P2.1 Executive Communication features, enabling natural language interactions with executive reporting, intelligent alerts, and strategic analysis.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PersonaChatInterface** - Main chat handler for persona requests
2. **PersonaP2Bridge** - Router between persona framework and P2.1 system
3. **ConversationFormatter** - Formats P2.1 data for natural conversation
4. **P2ChatAdapter** - Convenience layer for direct integration

### Integration Flow

```
Persona Request → PersonaP2Bridge → PersonaChatInterface → P2.1 System → ConversationFormatter → Response
```

## Features

### Natural Language Support

- **Executive Summaries**: "Give me an executive summary"
- **Alerts**: "What critical issues should I know about?"
- **Team Health**: "How is team performance?"
- **Risk Analysis**: "Any concerns I should be aware of?"
- **Initiative Status**: "How are our strategic projects?"

### Persona-Specific Responses

Each persona gets responses tailored to their perspective:

- **Diego**: Platform engineering focus, cross-team coordination
- **Camille**: Strategic technology, competitive advantage
- **Rachel**: Design systems, UX impact, accessibility
- **Alvaro**: Business value, ROI analysis, financial impact
- **Martin**: Platform architecture, technical health, scalability

### Intelligent Routing

The system automatically determines when to use P2.1 features based on:
- Request patterns (executive summary, alerts, etc.)
- Persona-specific keywords
- Context analysis

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from lib.claudedirector.persona_integration.p2_chat_adapter import ask_persona

# Natural language requests
response = ask_persona("diego", "How are our platform teams doing?")
response = ask_persona("camille", "Any strategic risks I should know about?")
response = ask_persona("rachel", "What's our design system adoption looking like?")
```

### Specific Features

```python
from lib.claudedirector.persona_integration.p2_chat_adapter import (
    executive_summary, current_alerts, team_health
)

# Executive summary for Diego (auto-detects VP Engineering stakeholder)
summary = executive_summary("diego")

# CEO-focused summary via Camille
summary = executive_summary("camille", stakeholder="ceo", period="current_month")

# Current alerts for Rachel (design perspective)
alerts = current_alerts("rachel")

# Team health from Martin's architectural perspective
health = team_health("martin")
```

### Advanced Integration

```python
from lib.claudedirector.persona_integration.persona_bridge import PersonaP2Bridge

bridge = PersonaP2Bridge()

# Handle any natural language request
response = bridge.handle_persona_request(
    "alvaro",
    "What business risks should I be concerned about this quarter?"
)

print(response.response_text)
print(f"Confidence: {response.confidence_score:.1%}")
print(f"Sources: {', '.join(response.data_sources)}")
```

## Response Format

All responses include:

```python
{
    "response": "Natural language response text",
    "confidence": 0.95,  # Confidence score (0-1)
    "data_sources": ["jira", "claudedirector"],
    "suggestions": ["Follow-up suggestion 1", "Follow-up suggestion 2"],
    "metadata": {
        "used_p2_system": True,
        "persona": "diego",
        "response_type": "executive_summary"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00"
}
```

## Configuration

### Stakeholder Mapping

Personas automatically map to appropriate stakeholder contexts:

- **Diego, Martin**: VP Engineering perspective
- **Camille, Alvaro**: CEO perspective
- **Rachel**: Product Team perspective

### Time Periods

Supports natural language time references:
- "today", "daily" → today
- "this week", "weekly" → current_week
- "this month", "monthly" → current_month
- "quarter", "quarterly" → current_quarter

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage with 49+ test cases:

```bash
# Run all persona integration tests
python3 -m unittest tests.persona_integration.test_persona_bridge
python3 -m unittest tests.persona_integration.test_chat_interface
python3 -m unittest tests.persona_integration.test_p2_chat_adapter
```

## Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to general responses if P2.1 unavailable
- **Error Recovery**: Provides helpful error messages and suggestions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Lower confidence for fallback responses

## Security

- **Input Validation**: All persona requests validated and sanitized
- **Access Control**: Respects existing P2.1 security boundaries
- **Data Privacy**: No sensitive data exposed in error messages

## Performance

- **Smart Caching**: Leverages P2.1 caching mechanisms
- **Efficient Routing**: Only uses P2.1 when relevant
- **Response Optimization**: Formats responses for conversation, not CLI

## Integration Points

### With Persona Framework
- Natural language processing
- Context-aware routing
- Persona-specific formatting

### With P2.1 System
- Executive summary generation
- Intelligent alert system
