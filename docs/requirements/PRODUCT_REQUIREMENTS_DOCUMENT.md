### Deployment Model
- **Local Installation**: Runs entirely on user's local machine
- **Single-User Focus**: Optimized for individual strategic leadership workflows
- **AI Tool Enhancement**: Framework that enhances existing AI tools (Cursor, Claude) rather than replacing them
- **Zero Server Dependencies**: No web service infrastructure required

### Distribution Strategy
- **Git-based Installation**: Direct installation from GitHub repository
- **Package Management**: Python package with pip/conda compatibility
- **IDE Integration**: Primary integration with Cursor IDE for seamless workflow
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for macOS, Windows, and Linux development environments
- **Lightweight Footprint**: <1GB memory usage, minimal system requirements
