      timeout_seconds: 10
      fallback: "in_memory_conversation_history"

    strategic_layer:
      failure_threshold: 5
      timeout_seconds: 15
      fallback: "workspace_file_scanning"

    stakeholder_layer:
      failure_threshold: 3
      timeout_seconds: 10
      fallback: "basic_stakeholder_detection"

    learning_layer:
      failure_threshold: 10
      timeout_seconds: 30
      fallback: "static_framework_selection"

3. **Performance Degradation**: System remains functional with reduced context capabilities
4. **User Transparency**: Clear notification when context layers are unavailable
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Health monitoring and automatic circuit breaker recovery

### Context Quality & Performance Architecture

class ContextQualityEngine:
    """Advanced context quality assessment for strategic guidance"""

    def calculate_context_quality_score(self, context_layers: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
        """Calculate comprehensive context quality (0.0-1.0)"""
        quality_factors = {
            'conversation_completeness': 0.25,    # Recent conversation depth
            'strategic_context_richness': 0.20,   # Initiative and goal context
            'stakeholder_context_depth': 0.20,    # Relationship context availability
            'learning_pattern_maturity': 0.15,    # Historical learning depth
            'organizational_context_coverage': 0.10,  # Cultural context breadth
            'cross_layer_coherence': 0.10         # Context layer consistency
        }

        weighted_score = sum(
            self._assess_context_factor(context_layers, factor) * weight
            for factor, weight in quality_factors.items()
        )

        return max(0.1, min(1.0, weighted_score))
```
