# Cursor Workspace Integration Guide

## 🎯 **Intelligent Workspace Detection**

ClaudeDirector automatically detects and works with your strategic files in:
- `leadership-workspace/` - Your primary workspace for strategic work
- `.claudedirector/strategic-intelligence/` - Framework personas and strategic frameworks

## 📁 **Workspace Structure Intelligence**

### **Strategic Work Areas**
- **current-initiatives/**: Active platform initiatives and quarterly goals
- **meeting-prep/**: VP 1-on-1s, SLT meetings, stakeholder conversations
- **strategy/**: Long-term strategic documents and analyses
- **budget-planning/**: Financial planning and resource allocation
- **vendor-evaluations/**: Technology partnerships and procurement decisions

### **Framework Resources**
- **frameworks/capital-allocation.md**: Engineering investment decisions, ROI analysis
- **frameworks/crucial-conversations.md**: High-stakes stakeholder discussions
- **personas/**: Strategic leadership personas (diego, camille, rachel, alvaro, martin, etc.)

## 🧠 **Automatic Context Loading**

When you mention these topics, relevant frameworks and personas activate automatically:

### **Financial Discussions** → Capital Allocation + Alvaro
- "Budget planning", "ROI analysis", "platform investment"
- "Build vs buy", "resource allocation", "engineering productivity"

### **Stakeholder Conversations** → Crucial Conversations + Rachel
- "VP meeting", "difficult conversation", "conflict resolution"
- "Executive communication", "stakeholder alignment", "resistance"

### **Technical Strategy** → Platform Intelligence + Martin + Diego
- "Platform architecture", "technical debt", "scalability"
- "Cross-team coordination", "design system", "international expansion"

## 💬 **Natural Chat Patterns**

Instead of specifying file paths, use natural language:

```
❌ "Read engineering-director-workspace/current-initiatives/q1-platform-goals.md"
✅ "Review my Q1 platform goals"

❌ "Analyze the file in budget-planning directory"
✅ "Help me with budget planning using capital allocation framework"

❌ "Use the crucial conversations framework from .claudedirector"
✅ "Prepare for a difficult conversation with executive leadership about technical debt"
```

## 🎯 **Strategic Context Persistence**

Your strategic context is preserved across Cursor sessions:
- Ongoing initiatives and stakeholder relationships
- Executive meeting history and outcomes
- Platform adoption metrics and ROI tracking
- Budget intelligence and investment decisions

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Open this repository in Cursor** (you're already here!)
2. **Start chatting naturally** about your strategic challenges
3. **Frameworks activate automatically** based on conversation context
4. **Personas provide expert guidance** tailored to your situation

No setup required - just start discussing your leadership challenges and ClaudeDirector will provide strategic intelligence using the most relevant frameworks and personas.
