- "What should our technology vision be for the next 3 years?"
- "How do we evaluate build vs buy decisions strategically?"

### **Engineering Director**
- "How should we structure our platform teams?"
  - **Challenge Response**: "What organizational assumptions are we making about team structure? Have we validated that team boundaries align with actual system boundaries?"
- "What's the ROI case for our design system investment?"
  - **Challenge Response**: "What evidence do we have that design system adoption will deliver the projected ROI? Have we measured current design inefficiencies?"
- "How do we coordinate across 8 different product teams?"
  - **Challenge Response**: "Are we solving a coordination problem or a communication problem? What's the root cause of the coordination challenges?"

### **Engineering Manager**
- "How do we improve cross-functional collaboration with Product?"
  - **Challenge Response**: "What assumptions are we making about why collaboration is poor? Have we validated the root causes with both teams?"
- "What's the best way to structure team rituals and meetings?"
  - **Challenge Response**: "Are we solving a process problem or a communication problem? What evidence shows current rituals aren't working?"
- "How do I help my team members grow their careers?"
  - **Challenge Response**: "What assumptions are we making about what career growth means to each individual? Have we validated their actual career goals?"

### **Staff/Principal Engineer**
- "How do I drive architectural decisions without direct authority?"
- "What's the strategy for reducing technical debt across systems?"
- "How do we evangelize platform adoption internally?"

### **Product Engineering Lead**

- "How do we balance feature delivery with platform investment?"

## üìä **Interactive Data Exploration Examples**

**Phase 7 Interactive Charts**: Transform strategic discussions from static presentations to dynamic data exploration.

### **Executive Dashboard Interactions**
Try these commands to experience interactive chart capabilities:

#### **Natural Language Chart Control**
```
üí¨ "Show me our Q3 platform adoption metrics"
ü§ñ Generating interactive dashboard with drill-down capabilities...

üí¨ "Filter by engineering teams only"
ü§ñ Applying team filter across all linked charts...

üí¨ "What's driving the spike in week 3?"
ü§ñ Analyzing performance patterns and generating strategic insights...
```

#### **Dynamic Data Discovery**
- **Click-to-Drill-Down**: Click any data point to explore underlying details
- **Cross-Chart Linking**: Selection in one chart automatically filters related charts
- **Time Navigation**: "Show me Q2 data" or "Compare with last quarter"
