## 🛡️ **P0 PROTECTION FRAMEWORK**

### **Continuous P0 Validation Strategy**
```yaml
After Each File Breakdown:
  1. Run specific P0 test: python test_[component]_p0.py
  2. Run full P0 suite: python run_mandatory_p0_tests.py
  3. Validate performance: Response time <500ms for affected features
  4. Test import dependencies: Ensure no circular imports
  5. Validate API compatibility: External interfaces unchanged

Critical P0 Tests Affected:
  - ML Pattern Detection P0 (Story 3A.1)
  - Context Engineering P0 (Story 3A.3)
  - Predictive Analytics Engine P0 (Story 3A.4)
  - Complete New Setup P0 (All stories)
  - Performance P0 (All stories)
```

### **Rollback Procedures**
```yaml
Rollback Triggers:
  - Any P0 test failure
  - Performance degradation >20%
  - Import dependency issues
  - API compatibility breaks

Rollback Process:
  1. git checkout HEAD~1 (previous commit)
  2. Run P0 validation to confirm stability
  3. Analyze failure root cause
  4. Implement fix in isolated branch
  5. Re-attempt breakdown with lessons learned
```

  - Each module focuses on single domain concept
  - Max 300 lines per class, 400 lines per file

Open/Closed:
  - Extension through composition and dependency injection
  - Abstract interfaces for extensibility
  - Plugin patterns where appropriate

Liskov Substitution:
  - Interfaces properly implemented
  - Polymorphism correctly applied
  - Behavioral contracts maintained

Interface Segregation:
