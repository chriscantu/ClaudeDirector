# Phase 9.4: Architectural Cleanup Specification

**Status**: ENHANCED SPECIFICATION (Sequential Thinking Complete)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Sequential Thinking Phase**: ‚úÖ Implementation Strategy Complete
**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days (REVISED from 2-3 days based on comprehensive analysis)
**Author**: Martin | Platform Architecture

## **üéØ Objective**

Resolve architectural violations identified in Phase 9.3 analysis where business logic is inappropriately placed in `.claudedirector/tools/` instead of `.claudedirector/lib/` per @PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md.

## **üìã Problem Statement**

**Root Issue**: 63 files in `.claudedirector/tools/` contain substantial business logic that should be in `.claudedirector/lib/` according to architectural principles.

**Specific Violations**:
1. **P0EnforcementSuite** - Core P0 validation business logic (tools/architecture/)
2. **MCPBloatAnalyzer** - 1,221 lines of analysis business logic (tools/architecture/)
3. **EnhancedSecurityScanner** - Security validation business logic (tools/quality/)
4. **MeetingIntelligenceManager** - Business intelligence logic (tools/automation/)
5. **WeeklyReportGenerator** - Core reporting functionality (tools/automation/)

## **üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principle Violation**

**@PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md states**:
- **`.claudedirector/lib/`** - Core System Library (business logic)
- **`.claudedirector/tools/`** - Development & Operations Tools (utilities only)

**Current State**: Tools directory contains business logic
**Target State**: Clean separation - tools contain only CLI interfaces and hooks

## **üìä Impact Assessment**

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Architectural compliance with @PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- ‚úÖ Improved code organization and discoverability
- ‚úÖ Better separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Enhanced testability of business logic

**Risks**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Import path changes may require updates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CLI tools need refactoring to use lib/ classes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hook scripts need import adjustments
