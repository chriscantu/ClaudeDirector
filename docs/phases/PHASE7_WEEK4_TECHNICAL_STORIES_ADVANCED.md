## ðŸš€ **Phase C: Advanced Features** (Days 5-7)

### **T-C1: Cross-Chart Linking Implementation**
**Story Points**: 6
**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)
**Owner**: Martin

**Technical Requirements**:
```python
class CrossChartLinkingEngine:
    """Enable linked interactions across multiple charts in chat"""

    def create_chart_linkage(self, charts: List[str], link_type: str) -> LinkageConfig:
        """Create linkage between multiple charts

        LINK TYPES:
        - FILTER_SYNC: Selection in one chart filters others
        - ZOOM_SYNC: Zoom level synchronized across charts
        - TIME_SYNC: Time range synchronized across charts
        - HIGHLIGHT_SYNC: Hover highlights related data across charts

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - <200ms cross-chart update time
        - Support for 2-5 linked charts simultaneously
        - Graceful handling of chart type mismatches
        - Memory efficient linkage tracking
        """

    async def propagate_interaction(self, source_chart: str, event: Dict) -> List[ChartUpdate]:
        """Propagate interaction from source chart to linked charts

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - Asynchronous updates to prevent UI blocking
        - Intelligent event filtering to prevent update loops
        - Context preservation across linked updates
        - Error isolation (failure in one chart doesn't break others)
        """
```

**Linking Scenarios**:
- **Executive Dashboard**: Multiple KPI charts with synchronized time filtering
- **Team Performance**: Individual metrics linked to team aggregations
- **Project Analysis**: Timeline charts linked to resource allocation charts
- **Strategic Planning**: Goal progress linked to resource investment charts

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] 2-5 charts can be linked simultaneously
- [ ] Cross-chart updates complete in <200ms
- [ ] Linking works with different chart types
- [ ] Error in one chart doesn't break others
- [ ] Visual feedback shows linked chart relationships

### **T-C2: Drill-Down Hierarchy Navigation**
**Story Points**: 7
**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)
**Owner**: Martin

**Technical Requirements**:
```python
class DrillDownNavigationEngine:
    """Enable hierarchical data exploration within chat interface"""

    def create_hierarchy_map(self, data: Dict, hierarchy_levels: List[str]) -> HierarchyMap:
        """Create navigable hierarchy from data structure

        HIERARCHY EXAMPLES:
        - Organization â†’ Department â†’ Team â†’ Individual
        - Project â†’ Epic â†’ Story â†’ Task
        - Time â†’ Year â†’ Quarter â†’ Month â†’ Week

        - Support for 3-6 hierarchy levels
        - Dynamic hierarchy detection from data
        - Breadcrumb navigation for current position
        - Context preservation during navigation
        """

    async def navigate_hierarchy(self, direction: str, target: str = None) -> NavigationResult:
        """Navigate up/down the data hierarchy

        NAVIGATION TYPES:
        - DRILL_DOWN: Move to more detailed level
        - ROLL_UP: Move to more aggregated level
        - JUMP_TO: Direct navigation to specific level
        - BACK: Return to previous navigation state

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - <300ms navigation response time
        - Smooth visual transitions between levels
        - Context breadcrumbs always visible
        - Data aggregation/disaggregation handling
        """
```

**Navigation Features**:
- **Visual Breadcrumbs**: "Organization > Engineering > Platform > Metrics"
- **Quick Jump**: Click breadcrumb level to jump directly
- **Context Preservation**: Remember selection when navigating back
- **Smart Aggregation**: Automatic data rollup/drilldown calculations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] 3-6 hierarchy levels supported
- [ ] Navigation response time <300ms
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation functional
- [ ] Context preserved across navigation
- [ ] Visual transitions smooth and professional
