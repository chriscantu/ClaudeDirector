# Phase 2.4: Performance Bottleneck Elimination

This branch is dedicated to Phase 2.4 implementation, targeting the elimination of 1,106+ lines from duplicate performance systems.

## Target Areas:
- Duplicate caching implementations beyond CacheManager
- Redundant memory allocation patterns
- Duplicate response handling patterns
- Scattered monitoring implementations

## Expected Outcome:
- 1,106+ lines eliminated
- Phase 2 total: 4,000+ lines eliminated (133% of target)
- 30% performance improvement through consolidation
