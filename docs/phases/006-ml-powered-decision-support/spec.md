## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As an engineering leader**, I want ClaudeDirector to predict strategic decision outcomes with high confidence and provide intelligent risk assessment, so that I can make data-driven strategic decisions with quantified success probabilities rather than intuition-based choices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a strategic decision context (team scaling, technology adoption, resource allocation), **When** I request decision support, **Then** ClaudeDirector provides ML-powered outcome predictions with ‚â•85% accuracy, confidence scores, and risk assessment based on similar organizational patterns.

2. **Given** multiple strategic options for a complex decision, **When** I engage the decision intelligence system, **Then** it provides comparative analysis with predicted outcomes, risk factors, and framework-based recommendations ranked by success probability.

3. **Given** ongoing strategic initiatives across my organization, **When** the proactive risk assessment system analyzes patterns, **Then** it identifies potential issues ‚â•2 weeks before they become critical and suggests preventive actions with success probability scores.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when ML models have confidence scores <85% for critical decisions?
- How does system handle contradictory predictions from different ML models?
- What occurs when organizational context changes faster than ML model retraining cycles?
- How does system maintain prediction accuracy with limited strategic decision training data?
