class ConversationalInteractionManager:
    """Handle natural language interactions with charts within chat"""

    async def process_interaction_query(self, query: str, context: Dict) -> InteractionResponse:
        """Process natural language chart interactions

        EXAMPLES:
        - "Show me Q3 data" → Update chart to show Q3 timeframe
        - "Filter by engineering team" → Apply team filter to current chart
        - "Drill down into platform metrics" → Navigate to platform-specific data
        - "Compare with last quarter" → Add comparison data overlay

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - <500ms response time for query processing
        - Context awareness of current chart state
        - Natural language understanding for chart operations
        - Integration with existing persona system
        """

    async def update_chart_from_conversation(self, chart_id: str, query: str) -> VisualizationResult:
        """Update interactive charts based on conversational input

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - Preserve existing chart state and interactions
        - Apply conversational updates incrementally
        - Maintain performance requirements (<500ms generation)
        - Generate follow-up suggestions for continued exploration
        """
```

**Natural Language Patterns**:
- **Time Navigation**: "Show me last quarter", "What about this month?"
- **Filtering**: "Filter by team", "Show only critical issues"
- **Drill-Down**: "Break this down by", "Show me details for"
- **Comparison**: "Compare with", "Show the difference between"
- **Context**: "Go back", "Show the overview", "Reset filters"

**Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **ALL COMPLETED**
- ✅ Natural language queries processed in <500ms (MCPServerConstants.Phase7B.INTERACTION_PROCESSING_TARGET)
- ✅ 6 core interaction intent types supported (time_navigation, data_filtering, drill_down, comparison, context_reset, insight_request)
- ✅ Context maintained across multiple interactions via QueryIntent and InteractionResponse
- ✅ Integration with strategic persona system through configuration-driven patterns
- ✅ Follow-up suggestions generated automatically with context-aware strategic guidance

### **T-B2: Chat Context Preservation** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Story Points**: 5 (DELIVERED)
**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)
**Owner**: Martin
**Implementation**: `.claudedirector/lib/mcp/chat_context_manager.py`

**Technical Requirements**:
```python
class ChatContextManager:
    """Preserve interactive chart state across chat sessions"""

    def save_interaction_state(self, chart_id: str, state: Dict) -> bool:
        """Save current chart interaction state to local database

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - SQLite storage for interaction history
        - <50MB total storage per user session
        - State compression for efficient storage
        - Encryption for sensitive data elements
        """

    def restore_interaction_state(self, chart_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
        """Restore previous chart interaction state

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - <100ms state restoration time
        - Graceful handling of corrupted state
        - Version compatibility across updates
        - Automatic cleanup of old interaction states
        """
```

**Context Elements**:
- Current chart filters and selections
- Drill-down navigation history
- Time range and zoom level
- User interaction preferences
- Related conversation context

**Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **ALL COMPLETED**
- ✅ Chart state preserved across chat sessions via SQLite database with optimized schema
- ✅ State restoration in <100ms (MCPServerConstants.Phase7B.CONTEXT_RESTORATION_TARGET)
- ✅ Storage usage <50MB per user (MCPServerConstants.Phase7B.MAX_SESSION_SIZE_MB)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of old states (30-day retention, MCPServerConstants.Phase7B.CLEANUP_AFTER_DAYS)
- ✅ Enterprise-grade gzip compression for large states with graceful fallback handling

### **T-B3: Follow-Up Suggestion Engine** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Story Points**: 4 (DELIVERED)
**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)
**Owner**: Martin
**Implementation**: Integrated into `ConversationalInteractionManager.generate_follow_up_suggestions()`

**Technical Requirements**:
```python
class FollowUpSuggestionEngine:
    """Generate intelligent follow-up suggestions for chart exploration"""

    def generate_suggestions(self, chart_state: Dict, context: Dict) -> List[str]:
        """Generate contextual follow-up suggestions

        EXAMPLES:
        - After drilling down: "Compare with other teams", "Show trend over time"
        - After filtering: "Remove filter", "Add additional filters"
        - After time navigation: "Show yearly trend", "Compare quarters"

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - Context-aware suggestion generation
        - Integration with strategic frameworks (Team Topologies, etc.)
        - Persona-specific suggestions (Diego focuses on strategic, Alvaro on ROI)
        - <100ms suggestion generation time
        """
```

**Suggestion Categories**:
- **Exploration**: "Drill down further", "Show related metrics"
- **Comparison**: "Compare with benchmark", "Show historical trend"
- **Context**: "Show team context", "Add organizational view"
- **Strategic**: "Calculate ROI impact", "Assess strategic alignment"

**Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **ALL COMPLETED**
- ✅ Context-aware suggestions generated based on current interaction intent
- ✅ Suggestions relevant to chart state and user interaction patterns
- ✅ Integration with strategic persona system via configuration-driven patterns
- ✅ <100ms generation time through efficient suggestion engine
- ✅ Strategic follow-up suggestions encourage deeper data exploration
