**Story Points**: 8
**Priority**: P0 (BLOCKING)
**Owner**: Martin

**Technical Requirements**:
```python
# .claudedirector/lib/mcp/conversational_interaction_manager.py
class ConversationalInteractionManager:
    """Handle natural language interactions with charts within chat"""

    async def process_interaction_query(self, query: str, context: Dict) -> InteractionResponse:
        """Process natural language chart interactions

        EXAMPLES:
        - "Show me Q3 data" → Update chart to show Q3 timeframe
        - "Filter by engineering team" → Apply team filter to current chart
        - "Drill down into platform metrics" → Navigate to platform-specific data
        - "Compare with last quarter" → Add comparison data overlay

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - <500ms response time for query processing
        - Context awareness of current chart state
        - Natural language understanding for chart operations
        - Integration with existing persona system
        """

    async def update_chart_from_conversation(self, chart_id: str, query: str) -> VisualizationResult:
        """Update interactive charts based on conversational input

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - Preserve existing chart state and interactions
        - Apply conversational updates incrementally
        - Maintain performance requirements (<500ms generation)
        - Generate follow-up suggestions for continued exploration
        """
```

**Natural Language Patterns**:
- **Time Navigation**: "Show me last quarter", "What about this month?"
- **Filtering**: "Filter by team", "Show only critical issues"
- **Drill-Down**: "Break this down by", "Show me details for"
- **Comparison**: "Compare with", "Show the difference between"
- **Context**: "Go back", "Show the overview", "Reset filters"

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Natural language queries processed in <500ms
- [ ] 15+ conversation patterns supported
- [ ] Context maintained across multiple interactions
- [ ] Integration with Diego/Alvaro personas for strategic guidance
- [ ] Follow-up suggestions generated automatically

### **T-B2: Chat Context Preservation**
**Story Points**: 5
**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)
**Owner**: Martin

**Technical Requirements**:
```python
class ChatContextManager:
    """Preserve interactive chart state across chat sessions"""

    def save_interaction_state(self, chart_id: str, state: Dict) -> bool:
        """Save current chart interaction state to local database

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - SQLite storage for interaction history
        - <50MB total storage per user session
        - State compression for efficient storage
        - Encryption for sensitive data elements
        """

    def restore_interaction_state(self, chart_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
        """Restore previous chart interaction state

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - <100ms state restoration time
        - Graceful handling of corrupted state
        - Version compatibility across updates
        - Automatic cleanup of old interaction states
        """
```

**Context Elements**:
- Current chart filters and selections
- Drill-down navigation history
- Time range and zoom level
- User interaction preferences
- Related conversation context

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Chart state preserved across chat sessions
- [ ] State restoration in <100ms
- [ ] Storage usage <50MB per user
- [ ] Automatic cleanup of old states (>30 days)
- [ ] Graceful handling of state corruption

### **T-B3: Follow-Up Suggestion Engine**
**Story Points**: 4
**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)
**Owner**: Martin

**Technical Requirements**:
```python
class FollowUpSuggestionEngine:
    """Generate intelligent follow-up suggestions for chart exploration"""

    def generate_suggestions(self, chart_state: Dict, context: Dict) -> List[str]:
        """Generate contextual follow-up suggestions

        EXAMPLES:
        - After drilling down: "Compare with other teams", "Show trend over time"
        - After filtering: "Remove filter", "Add additional filters"
        - After time navigation: "Show yearly trend", "Compare quarters"

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - Context-aware suggestion generation
        - Integration with strategic frameworks (Team Topologies, etc.)
        - Persona-specific suggestions (Diego focuses on strategic, Alvaro on ROI)
        - <100ms suggestion generation time
        """
```

**Suggestion Categories**:
- **Exploration**: "Drill down further", "Show related metrics"
- **Comparison**: "Compare with benchmark", "Show historical trend"
- **Context**: "Show team context", "Add organizational view"
- **Strategic**: "Calculate ROI impact", "Assess strategic alignment"

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] 5+ contextual suggestions generated per interaction
- [ ] Suggestions relevant to current chart state
- [ ] Integration with persona strategic focus
- [ ] <100ms generation time
- [ ] Click-to-execute suggestion functionality
