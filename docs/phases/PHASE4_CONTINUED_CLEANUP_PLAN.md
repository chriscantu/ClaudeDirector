## üèóÔ∏è SEQUENTIAL THINKING METHODOLOGY

### **Proven Patterns from Phase 3B:**
1. **Processor Consolidation**: Create centralized logic processors
2. **Facade Transformation**: Convert monoliths to lightweight delegates
3. **P0 Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility through mocks/caching
4. **Systematic Deletion**: Remove deprecated/backup files after validation

### **Phase 4 Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Week 1**: Large file analysis and processor creation
2. **Week 2**: Facade transformation and delegation implementation
3. **Week 3**: P0 compatibility validation and systematic deletion
4. **Week 4**: Final consolidation and architectural cleanup
