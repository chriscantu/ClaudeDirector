## Week 2 Mission: Aggressive Component Consolidation

**Goal**: Apply Phase 3A stakeholder intelligence consolidation patterns to achieve **Net -650 lines**
**Foundation**: Week 1 achieved Net -325 lines through type extraction with 100% P0 test coverage maintained.

**Strategy**: Consolidate over-engineered components using proven DRY-over-SOLID methodology that delivered 66% stakeholder intelligence reduction in Phase 3A.

## 📋 Days 6-7: Organizational Intelligence Consolidation (Story 3B.1.2)

### **Strategic Approach: Apply Phase 3A Success Pattern**
Phase 3A achieved 66% stakeholder intelligence reduction by consolidating over-engineered components. Apply identical methodology to organizational intelligence.

### **Day 6 Morning: Consolidation Analysis (2 hours)**

#### **Step 1: Identify Organizational Fragmentation**
```bash
# Analyze organizational_layer.py for consolidation opportunities
grep -n "class.*:" organizational_layer.py | head -10
# Expected fragmented classes:
# - TeamDynamicsAnalyzer (~150 lines)
# - CulturalAssessment (~130 lines)
# - OrganizationalMetrics (~120 lines)
# Total fragmented: ~400 lines to consolidate
```

### **Day 6 Afternoon: Create OrganizationalProcessor (6 hours)**

#### **Step 1: Create Consolidated Processor (Following StakeholderProcessor Pattern)**
```python
# File: organizational_processor.py (target: ~300 lines consolidated functionality)
#!/usr/bin/env python3
