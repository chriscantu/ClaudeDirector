- **Target**: ~400 lines elimination (sophisticated cross-module patterns)
- **Innovation**: AST similarity scoring across different modules
- **Challenge**: Maintain module boundaries and architectural integrity
- **Safety**: High-risk operations with comprehensive validation systems

### **Story 3.3: Week 3 DRY & Architectural Compliance Review**
**Strategic Approach**: Comprehensive validation of advanced elimination techniques
- **Objective**: Validate 3,000+ cumulative line elimination achievement
- **Assessment**: Evaluate validator system effectiveness and AST accuracy
- **Compliance**: 100% adherence to PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md and OVERVIEW.md
- **Strategic**: Prepare foundation for potential Week 4 enterprise optimizations

## üß† **SEQUENTIAL THINKING METHODOLOGY**

### **Phase 1: Method-Level Analysis (Story 3.1)**
1. **AST Pattern Detection**: Identify duplicate business logic within BaseProcessor methods
2. **Safety Validation**: P0 test execution before any elimination
3. **Surgical Elimination**: Precise removal with functionality preservation
4. **Validation Loop**: Continuous P0 testing throughout elimination process

### **Phase 2: Cross-Module Optimization (Story 3.2)**
1. **Advanced AST Analysis**: Cross-module similarity scoring and pattern detection
2. **Architectural Validation**: Ensure module boundaries remain intact
3. **Safe Consolidation**: Eliminate patterns while preserving integration points
4. **Enterprise Testing**: Comprehensive validation across all affected modules

### **Phase 3: Comprehensive Review (Story 3.3)**
1. **Achievement Validation**: Confirm 3,000+ cumulative line elimination
2. **System Assessment**: Evaluate validator effectiveness and accuracy
3. **Architectural Compliance**: 100% adherence to established principles
4. **Strategic Planning**: Assess potential for additional enterprise optimizations
