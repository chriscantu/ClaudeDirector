## Summary
Transform ClaudeDirector from reactive strategic advisor to proactive intelligence platform with ML-powered decision support, enhanced organizational memory, and predictive analytics capabilities. Build on existing persona and framework architecture while adding strategic intelligence layer compatible with GitHub Spec-Kit methodology.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (existing ClaudeDirector stack)
**Primary Dependencies**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy (ML), existing ClaudeDirector libs
**Storage**: SQLite + DuckDB + Faiss (existing hybrid architecture)
**Testing**: pytest + existing P0 test framework
**Target Platform**: macOS/Linux development, Cursor integration
**Project Type**: Strategic Intelligence Enhancement (extends existing platform)
**Performance Goals**: ≤2000ms strategic analysis, ≥85% ML accuracy, ≥98% memory retention
**Constraints**: Single-user privacy, enterprise compliance, real-time performance
**Scale/Scope**: Strategic intelligence for engineering leadership, executive decision support

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (strategic intelligence enhancement to existing ClaudeDirector)
- Using framework directly? (leverages existing ClaudeDirector architecture)
- Single data model? (extends existing strategic context model)
- Avoiding patterns? (builds on proven persona and framework patterns)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (extends .claudedirector/lib/ structure)
- Libraries listed:
  - strategic_intelligence/ (ML decision support)
  - enhanced_memory/ (organizational context engine)
  - predictive_analytics/ (strategic outcome prediction)
- CLI per library: strategic-analysis, memory-query, prediction-engine
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned for strategic intelligence APIs

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (P0 tests for strategic intelligence)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? (mandatory P0 test validation)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed
- Real dependencies used? (actual ML models, strategic context data)
- Integration tests for: ML model accuracy, strategic memory retention, framework integration
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? (strategic decision audit trails)
- Frontend logs → backend? (Cursor integration with strategic intelligence)
- Error context sufficient? (ML model confidence, prediction accuracy)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (Phase 5.0.0 - major strategic enhancement)
- BUILD increments on every change? (follows existing ClaudeDirector versioning)
- Breaking changes handled? (backward compatible with existing personas/frameworks)

**Structure Decision**: Enhancement to existing ClaudeDirector architecture (maintains proven patterns)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - ML framework selection for strategic decision support
   - Integration patterns with existing ClaudeDirector architecture
   - Performance optimization for real-time strategic analysis
   - Strategic memory persistence and retrieval patterns

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research ML frameworks for strategic decision support in Python"
   Task: "Analyze integration patterns for ClaudeDirector architecture enhancement"
   Task: "Find best practices for real-time ML inference in strategic contexts"
   Task: "Research organizational memory and context persistence patterns"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [ML framework and integration approach chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen for strategic intelligence context]
   - Alternatives considered: [other frameworks and patterns evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions validated

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Strategic Decision, ML Strategic Model, Organizational Context
   - Strategic Framework Intelligence, Proactive Intelligence Engine
   - Validation rules from strategic requirements
   - State transitions for strategic decision lifecycle

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Strategic analysis endpoints (decision support, risk assessment)
   - Memory system APIs (context preservation, stakeholder intelligence)
   - Predictive analytics interfaces (outcome prediction, pattern detection)
   - Output OpenAPI schemas to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Strategic decision analysis validation tests
   - Memory retention and retrieval accuracy tests
   - ML model performance and accuracy tests
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Executive strategic decision support scenarios
   - Proactive intelligence and early warning scenarios
   - Strategic framework integration and synthesis scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-claude-context.sh` for Claude integration
   - Add strategic intelligence capabilities to existing context
   - Preserve existing persona and framework context
   - Update with strategic analysis and prediction capabilities

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing P0 tests, quickstart.md, enhanced CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (strategic contracts, ML models, memory system)
- Each strategic capability → P0 test task [P]
- Each ML model → accuracy validation task [P]
- Each memory component → retention test task [P]
- Implementation tasks to make strategic intelligence tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: P0 tests before strategic intelligence implementation
- Dependency order: Enhanced memory → ML models → Strategic analysis → Predictive analytics
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent strategic components)

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Strategic intelligence implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run P0 tests, execute quickstart.md, strategic performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | N/A | N/A |

**Justification**: Strategic intelligence enhancement builds on existing ClaudeDirector architecture without introducing unnecessary complexity. Leverages proven patterns while adding focused strategic capabilities.
