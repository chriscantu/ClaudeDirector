#### **Task 8.1.1: Create BaseManager Foundation**
**Location**: `.claudedirector/lib/core/`
**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours
**DRY Compliance**: Establishes single source of truth for manager infrastructure

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Create BaseManager Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Following PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md core/ organization
   touch .claudedirector/lib/core/base_manager.py
   touch .claudedirector/lib/core/manager_types.py
   ```

2. **Implement BaseManagerConfig Dataclass**
   - Standardized configuration following existing patterns in `core/models.py`
   - Include: manager_name, enable_metrics, enable_caching, log_level, performance_tracking
   - Custom_config dict for manager-specific settings

3. **Implement BaseManager Abstract Class**
   - Inherit from ABC for proper abstraction
   - Consolidated infrastructure: logging, metrics, caching, error handling
   - Abstract `manage()` method for implementation by subclasses
   - Structured logging with manager context binding (following existing patterns)

4. **Add Performance Metrics Infrastructure**
   - Integrate with existing `performance/` module patterns
