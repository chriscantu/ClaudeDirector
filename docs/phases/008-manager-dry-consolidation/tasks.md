#### **Task 8.1.3: Refactor Core Infrastructure Managers** 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (2/8 Complete)
**Actual Effort**: 6 hours (3 hours per completed manager)
**Target Managers**: DatabaseManager ✅, CacheManager ✅, PerformanceManager, MemoryManager, ConfigurationManager, SecurityManager, LoggingManager, MetricsManager

**Per-Manager Refactoring Process**:

**Sub-Task 8.1.3.1: DatabaseManager Refactoring** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Location**: `.claudedirector/lib/core/database.py`
**Results**: Successfully refactored to BaseManager inheritance
**Lines Eliminated**: ~95 lines (infrastructure patterns consolidated)

1. **Before Analysis & Documentation**
   - Document current line count and infrastructure patterns
   - Identify duplicate logging, metrics, and error handling code
   - Catalog existing API methods for compatibility verification

2. **BaseManager Integration**
   ```python
   # Change from:
   class DatabaseManager:
       def __init__(self, config_path=None):
           self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
           self.metrics = {}
           # ... duplicate infrastructure

   # Change to:
   class DatabaseManager(BaseManager):
       def __init__(self, config: BaseManagerConfig, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(config, **kwargs)
           # Manager-specific initialization only
   ```

3. **Infrastructure Removal**
   - Remove manual logger initialization (use inherited `self.logger`)
   - Remove manual metrics setup (use inherited `self.metrics`)
   - Remove duplicate error handling patterns
   - Remove manual configuration management

4. **Abstract Method Implementation**
   ```python
   def manage(self, operation: str, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
       """Implement BaseManager abstract method"""
       # Delegate to existing database operations
       return self._execute_database_operation(operation, *args, **kwargs)
   ```

5. **API Compatibility Validation**
   - Ensure all existing database methods work unchanged
   - Maintain existing method signatures
   - Preserve existing error handling behavior

6. **Testing & Validation**
