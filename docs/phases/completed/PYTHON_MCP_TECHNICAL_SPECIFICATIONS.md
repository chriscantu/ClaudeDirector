## 🎯 **Quick Reference**

### **Key Technical Components**
- **Strategic Python MCP Server**: Sandboxed Python execution with strategic constraints
- **Executive Visualization Engine**: Publication-quality interactive charts
- **Security Framework**: Resource limits, import restrictions, audit trails
- **Performance Targets**: <5s execution, <3s visualization generation

### **Implementation Dependencies**
- **Phase 1 Foundation**: Must be completed before Phase 2
- **Security Requirements**: Sandboxed execution with strategic scope validation
- **Performance Standards**: ClaudeDirector <5s response time compliance
- **P0 Test Compliance**: All 37 existing P0 tests must remain passing

### **Integration Points**
- **MCP Protocol**: Standard MCP server implementation
- **Transparency System**: Complete disclosure of Python execution
- **Persona System**: Optimized execution for 5 strategic personas
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverages current pandas/numpy capabilities

## 🛡️ **Security & Compliance Summary**

### **Strategic Scope Enforcement**
- Only strategic analysis capabilities allowed
- Blocked system-level operations and file access
- Import restrictions to strategic libraries only
- Complete audit trail for all executions

### **Performance Assurance**
- Resource limits: 512MB memory, 30s execution time
- Response time targets: <5s strategic analysis, <3s visualization
- Throughput capacity: 10+ concurrent strategic analyses
- P0 test compliance maintained throughout implementation
