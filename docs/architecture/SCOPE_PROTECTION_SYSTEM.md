# üõ°Ô∏è ClaudeDirector Scope Protection System

**CRITICAL**: Prevent scope creep and maintain alignment with core PRD requirements.

## üéØ CORE SCOPE DEFINITION

### **WHAT CLAUDEDIRECTOR IS:**
- **Local single-user framework** that enhances AI tools like Cursor and Claude
- **Individual strategic leadership enhancement** for VP/CTO/Director/Manager/Staff/Product leads
- **Zero server dependencies** - runs entirely on user's local machine
- **AI tool enhancement** - framework that enhances existing AI tools rather than replacing them
- **Privacy-first** - all strategic data stays on user's local machine

### **WHAT CLAUDEDIRECTOR IS NOT:**
- ‚ùå Multi-user collaboration platform
- ‚ùå Real-time chat system between users
- ‚ùå Web service or server-based application
- ‚ùå Replacement for existing AI tools
- ‚ùå Team coordination software
- ‚ùå Cross-computer communication system

## üö® MANDATORY SCOPE VALIDATION

### **Before Any Phase Planning:**
1. **PRD Alignment Check**: Does this align with "local single-user framework"?
2. **Architecture Validation**: Does this require server infrastructure? (If yes, STOP)
3. **User Model Check**: Does this assume multiple users? (If yes, STOP)
4. **Enhancement vs Replacement**: Are we enhancing existing AI tools or replacing them?

### **Phase Planning Checklist:**
- [ ] Maintains single-user focus
- [ ] Enhances individual strategic leadership
- [ ] Requires zero server dependencies
- [ ] Improves AI tool integration (Cursor/Claude)
- [ ] Preserves privacy-first architecture
- [ ] Aligns with PRD P0/P1 priorities

## üìã VALID PHASE 3+ DIRECTIONS

### **Single-User Strategic Leadership Enhancement:**
- **Enhanced Persona Intelligence**: Deeper individual strategic guidance
- **Advanced Framework Integration**: More sophisticated strategic framework application
- **Improved Context Engineering**: Better conversation memory and strategic context
- **Enhanced ML-Powered Insights**: Individual strategic decision support
- **Better Integration Patterns**: Smoother Cursor/Claude integration
- **Advanced Analytics**: Individual productivity and strategic effectiveness metrics

### **PRD-Aligned P1 Features:**
- **Always-On MCP Enhancement**: 100% enterprise-grade AI consistency
- **Advanced AI Intelligence**: ML pipeline for individual strategic insights
- **Enterprise Integration**: GitHub/Jira sync for individual workflow enhancement
- **Advanced Analytics**: Individual strategic effectiveness reporting

## üîí ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

### **Pre-Planning Validation:**
Every phase plan MUST pass this validation:
```
SCOPE_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST:
1. Single-user focused? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
2. Local machine only? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
3. Enhances existing AI tools? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
4. Zero server dependencies? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
5. Aligns with PRD priorities? ‚úÖ/‚ùå

IF ANY ‚ùå: STOP - Revise scope to align with PRD
```

### **Documentation Requirements:**
- Every phase plan must reference specific PRD sections
- Must explicitly state how it enhances single-user experience
- Must confirm zero server infrastructure requirements

## üéØ PHASE 3 CORRECTION

**INVALID SCOPE** (Previous): Multi-user real-time collaboration
**VALID SCOPE** (Corrected): Enhanced single-user strategic capabilities

**Recommended Phase 3 Focus:**
- Advanced persona intelligence with deeper strategic insights
- Enhanced framework integration for individual strategic analysis
- Improved context engineering for better conversation continuity
- ML-powered individual strategic decision support
