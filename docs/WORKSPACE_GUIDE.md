# ClaudeDirector Workspace Organization Guide

## 🎯 **New Clean Separation: Framework vs Your Work**

ClaudeDirector repository structure has been optimized for **professional presentation and maintainability**. Your actual leadership work should now be **separate from the framework source code**.

---

## 📂 **Your Workspace Options**

### **🏆 Recommended: Separate Workspace Directory**

```bash
# Your leadership workspace (outside ClaudeDirector repo)
~/leadership-workspace/
├── current-initiatives/          # Your ongoing projects
├── meeting-prep/                 # Meeting materials and prep
├── budget-planning/              # Budget analysis and planning
├── stakeholder-analysis/         # Team and stakeholder work
├── platform-strategy/            # Your platform strategy docs
├── configs/                      # Your personal configurations
└── data/                        # Your working data files
```

**Benefits:**
- **Clean separation** between framework and your work
- **Version control independence** - track your work separately
- **Professional structure** - framework repo is demo-ready
- **Flexibility** - organize your workspace however you prefer

### **⚡ Quick Migration from Your Existing Work:**

```bash
# Copy your existing workspace from the old location
cp -r ../platform-eng-leader-claude-config/workspace/* ~/leadership-workspace/

# Or create symbolic link if you prefer to keep it in current location
ln -s ../platform-eng-leader-claude-config/workspace ~/leadership-workspace
```
