# AI Trust Framework - Capability Boundaries

**Document Type**: Strategic Framework | **Status**: Active | **Owner**: Strategic Team

---

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

This framework establishes clear boundaries for what AI assistant capabilities can be trusted versus what requires external oversight, preventing wasted effort on unreliable AI behavioral promises.

**Key Insight**: AI cannot reliably police itself. External systems work, internal self-enforcement does not.

## 🎯 **Trust Categories**

### **🟢 HIGH TRUST - Reliable AI Capabilities**

**Technical Implementation**
- ✅ **Code generation from clear specifications**
- ✅ **Function implementation with defined inputs/outputs**
- ✅ **API integration following documentation**
- ✅ **Data structure creation and manipulation**
- ✅ **Algorithm implementation from pseudocode**

**Analysis & Research**
- ✅ **Code analysis and pattern detection**
- ✅ **Documentation review and synthesis**
- ✅ **System architecture explanation**
- ✅ **Comparative analysis of approaches**
- ✅ **Information extraction from existing code**

**Following Instructions**
- ✅ **Step-by-step task execution**
- ✅ **Template-based content generation**
- ✅ **Structured format compliance**
- ✅ **Specific file operations (create, edit, delete)**
- ✅ **Command execution with clear parameters**

### **🟡 MEDIUM TRUST - Context-Dependent Capabilities**

**Design & Planning**
- ⚠️ **System design recommendations** (verify with expertise)
- ⚠️ **Architecture decisions** (validate against requirements)
- ⚠️ **Performance optimization suggestions** (test and measure)
- ⚠️ **Security recommendations** (audit with security expertise)
- ⚠️ **Best practice guidance** (validate against current standards)

**Problem Solving**
- ⚠️ **Debugging complex issues** (verify solutions work)
- ⚠️ **Root cause analysis** (validate with evidence)
- ⚠️ **Integration troubleshooting** (test proposed fixes)
- ⚠️ **Performance issue diagnosis** (measure and confirm)

### **🔴 ZERO TRUST - Unreliable AI Capabilities**

**Behavioral Consistency**
- ❌ **Process compliance promises** ("I will follow X methodology")
- ❌ **Consistent behavior across sessions** (no memory persistence)
- ❌ **Self-discipline enforcement** ("I will remember to do Y")
- ❌ **Quality assurance promises** ("I will always check Z")

**Self-Enforcement Systems**
- ❌ **AI policing AI behavior** (fundamental architectural limitation)
- ❌ **Self-validation systems** (AI cannot reliably validate itself)
- ❌ **Behavioral modification systems** (AI cannot change its own patterns)
- ❌ **Process enforcement on AI actions** (requires external oversight)

**Memory & Learning**
- ❌ **Remembering context across conversations** (no persistent memory)
- ❌ **Learning from past mistakes** (no learning mechanism)
- ❌ **Adapting behavior based on feedback** (no behavioral adaptation)
- ❌ **Maintaining state between sessions** (stateless by design)

## 🛠️ **Practical Application Guidelines**

### **For High Trust Tasks**
```
✅ Good Request: "Implement a function that takes user_id and returns user profile data"
✅ Good Request: "Analyze this code and identify all database queries"
✅ Good Request: "Create a React component following this design spec"
```

### **For Medium Trust Tasks**
```
⚠️ Verify Request: "Recommend the best database for this use case" → Validate recommendation
⚠️ Verify Request: "Debug this performance issue" → Test the proposed solution
⚠️ Verify Request: "Design the system architecture" → Review with technical expertise
```

### **For Zero Trust Tasks**
```
❌ Avoid Request: "Always follow the spec-kit process when coding"
❌ Avoid Request: "Remember to apply Sequential Thinking in future conversations"
❌ Avoid Request: "Build a system to enforce your own behavior"
```

## 🔧 **Context7 MCP Integration**

**Leveraging Context7 patterns for intelligent trust boundary application:**

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify request types and map to trust categories
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate reliability based on task complexity and AI limitations
- **Validation Requirements**: Determine appropriate oversight level needed
- **Fallback Strategies**: Define external validation when AI capabilities are insufficient

---

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

**Immediate Indicators**:
- Reduced time spent on AI behavioral modification attempts
- Clear expectations set for AI capabilities
- Appropriate external validation applied to medium/zero trust tasks

**Long-term Indicators**:
- No new AI self-enforcement systems built
- Efficient task delegation based on trust boundaries
- Consistent application of external oversight where needed
