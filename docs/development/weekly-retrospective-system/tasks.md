# Weekly Retrospective System - Task Index

## Task Organization

This directory contains focused task breakdowns for the Weekly Retrospective System implementation:

### Core Task Files

#### [Phase 1 Tasks](tasks-phase1.md) - Foundation Architecture (Weeks 1-2)
- Infrastructure setup and core conversation flow
- Class extension and data layer implementation
- Command registration and session state management
- **Critical Path**: Foundation for all subsequent phases

#### [Phase 2 Tasks](tasks-phase2.md) - Intelligence Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- MCP Sequential integration and theme extraction
- Trend analysis foundation and pattern recognition
- **Dependencies**: Requires Phase 1 completion

#### [Phase 3 Tasks](tasks-phase3.md) - Advanced Analytics (Weeks 5-6)
- Monte Carlo forecasting and predictive insights
- Personalized recommendation engine and success factor analysis
- **Dependencies**: Requires Phase 2 MCP integration

#### [Phase 4 Tasks](tasks-phase4.md) - Polish and Optimization (Weeks 7-8)
- Performance optimization and user experience enhancement
- Comprehensive error handling and export capabilities
- **Dependencies**: Requires core functionality from Phases 1-3

### Implementation Guidance

#### Critical Path Analysis
1. **Foundation** → **Intelligence** → **Analytics** → **Polish**
2. **Core infrastructure must be completed before intelligence layer**
3. **MCP integration required for advanced analytics**
4. **Performance optimization depends on core functionality completion**

#### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Data layer** can be developed in parallel with **UI layer**
- **Theme extraction** can be developed in parallel with **trend analysis**
- **Forecasting** can be developed in parallel with **insight generation**

#### Resource Allocation
- **Phase 1**: 40% infrastructure, 30% conversation flow, 20% data layer, 10% testing
- **Phase 2**: 50% MCP integration, 30% analytics foundation, 20% testing
- **Phase 3**: 60% advanced analytics, 25% insight generation, 15% testing
- **Phase 4**: 50% performance optimization, 35% UX enhancement, 15% testing

### Milestone Checkpoints
- **Week 2**: Core retrospective collection functional
- **Week 4**: Basic trend analysis working
- **Week 6**: Advanced analytics and insights generated
- **Week 8**: Production-ready system with optimization

### Development Standards
- **DRY Compliance**: Reuse existing infrastructure and patterns
- **SOLID Principles**: Clean, maintainable code architecture
- **Test Coverage**: >90% unit test coverage for all new functionality
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and README updates
