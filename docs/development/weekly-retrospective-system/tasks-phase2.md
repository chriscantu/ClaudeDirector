## Phase 2 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Analysis Accuracy**: >85% accuracy in theme extraction
- **Performance**: <10 seconds for trend analysis generation
- **MCP Integration**: <5 seconds for MCP Sequential analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: >80% accuracy in recurring pattern identification

### Quality Metrics
- **Framework Integration**: Seamless integration with existing MCP infrastructure
- **Graceful Degradation**: System functions without MCP when unavailable
- **Analysis Quality**: Insights provide actionable value to users
- **Statistical Validity**: All correlations and patterns statistically significant

### Risk Mitigation

   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing with diverse retrospective data
   - *Contingency*: Manual theme categorization as fallback

3. **Performance at Scale**
   - *Risk*: Analysis performance degrades with growing data
   - *Mitigation*: Implement caching and indexing strategies
   - *Contingency*: Data sampling for large datasets
