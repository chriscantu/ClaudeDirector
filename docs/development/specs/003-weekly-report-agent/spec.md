- **REQ-F4**: Multi-team data aggregation across Web Platform, Design System, i18n, UI Shell, Header/Nav teams
- **REQ-F5**: Risk assessment and blocker identification with mitigation strategy recommendations

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **REQ-NF1**: Performance - Complete report generation in <300 seconds end-to-end
- **REQ-NF2**: Security - Secure Jira API authentication with token management and audit trails
- **REQ-NF3**: Compliance - Full data source attribution, zero invented metrics policy enforcement

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **System Design**
```
Weekly Report Agent Architecture

[Configuration Layer]
├── Team Mappings (Web Platform, Design System, i18n, UI Shell, Header/Nav)
├── Business Value Frameworks (Platform → Org Impact Translation)
├── Report Templates (Executive Format Standards)
└── Jira Project Mappings (Team → Project → Epic Hierarchies)

[Data Collection Layer]
├── Jira API Client (Epic queries, completion forecasting, metadata extraction)
├── Analytics Integration (Platform adoption metrics, developer satisfaction)
├── Cross-Team Coordinator (Dependency analysis, resource constraint identification)
└── Historical Context Manager (Trend analysis, comparative insights)

[Analysis Engine]
├── Epic Completion Forecasting (Monte Carlo simulation based on historical velocity)
├── Business Impact Calculator (Technical work → Organizational outcome translation)
├── Risk Assessment Engine (Blocker detection, dependency analysis, mitigation planning)
└── Strategic Insights Generator (Pattern recognition, trend analysis, recommendations)

[Report Generation Layer]
├── Executive Summary Generator (VP/SLT appropriate messaging with single-question focus)
├── Template Processor (weekly-report-2025-08-02.md format compliance)
├── Data Integrity Validator (Source attribution verification, no-invented-numbers enforcement)
└── Stakeholder Customizer (VP Engineering/Product/Design specific messaging)
```

### **Component Breakdown**
1. **WeeklyReportAgent**: Main orchestration component implementing Agent pattern with autonomous operation
2. **JiraDataCollector**: Specialized component for Jira API integration with error handling and rate limiting
3. **BusinessValueTranslator**: Strategic component applying UI Foundation specific frameworks for technical → business translation
4. **ReportAssembler**: Template engine with data integrity validation and executive formatting standards

### **Data Flow**
```
Configuration Loading → Multi-Team Data Collection → Cross-Team Analysis →
Business Value Translation → Risk Assessment → Executive Summary Generation →
Template Processing → Data Integrity Validation → Report Delivery
```

### **Integration Points**
- **Jira REST API**: Epic queries, project data, team assignments, completion forecasting
- **UI Foundation Analytics**: Platform adoption metrics, developer experience data
- **Executive Communication Templates**: weekly-report-2025-08-02.md format standards
