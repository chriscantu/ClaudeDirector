   - Add UI Foundation specific value mapping (Platform, Design System, i18n)
   - Create strategic insight generation with achievement/concern identification

3. **Data Integrity Framework**
   - Implement strict source attribution for all metrics
   - Add data coverage percentage calculation and confidence scoring
   - Create validation framework preventing invented numbers

#### **Deliverables**
- [ ] `EpicAnalysis` and `TeamAnalysis` dataclasses with full attribution
- [ ] Business value translation using strategic frameworks
- [ ] Monte Carlo completion probability forecasting
- [ ] Cross-team dependency analysis engine
- [ ] Data integrity validation with source tracking

#### **Success Criteria**
- Agent generates accurate completion forecasts with confidence intervals
- Business value translation produces meaningful organizational impact narratives
- 100% of metrics have traceable data source attribution
- Multi-team data aggregation covers all UI Foundation teams

#### **Dependencies**
- Historical velocity data for forecasting accuracy
- Business value mapping frameworks finalized
- Team project mappings configured and validated

### **Phase 3: Report Generation & Executive Formatting** (Week 3)

**Objective**: Generate executive-ready reports following organizational communication standards

#### **Technical Tasks**
1. **Executive Report Assembly**
   - Integrate with existing `ExecutiveSummary` class
   - Implement template-driven report generation (weekly-report-2025-08-02.md format)
   - Add stakeholder-specific messaging (VP Engineering/Product/Design)

2. **Quality Assurance Framework**
   - Implement comprehensive report validation
   - Add executive communication standards compliance checking
   - Create performance benchmarking (300 second generation time limit)

3. **Report Delivery & Storage**
   - Implement structured file output with timestamp-based naming
   - Add report archival and version management
   - Create delivery mechanisms (file system, optional email integration)

#### **Deliverables**
- [ ] Executive report generation following approved template format
- [ ] Quality validation framework with multiple checkpoints
- [ ] Report storage and archival system
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and recovery

#### **Success Criteria**
- Generated reports match manual report quality and format standards
- Report generation completes within 300 second performance target
- Quality validation passes with >95% consistency rate
- Reports include proper data source attribution and confidence metrics

#### **Dependencies**
- Approved executive report template (weekly-report-2025-08-02.md)
- Quality standards defined and validated by stakeholders
- Performance requirements validated through testing

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Testing Framework**
- **Agent Components**: Test all WeeklyReportAgent methods with mock dependencies
- **Data Processing**: Validate epic analysis, business value translation, forecasting algorithms
- **Configuration**: Test YAML loading, validation, error handling scenarios
- **Integration Points**: Mock Jira API calls, validate data transformation pipelines

### **Integration Testing**
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete report generation with test Jira data
- **Cross-Team Data**: Validate multi-team aggregation and dependency analysis
- **Quality Gates**: Test report validation, performance benchmarks, error scenarios
- **Template Compliance**: Verify output format matches executive standards

### **P0 Business Critical Testing**
- **Data Integrity**: Zero tolerance testing for invented metrics or missing attribution
- **Executive Format**: Strict compliance testing against organizational communication standards
- **Performance Requirements**: Load testing to validate 300 second generation limit
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation testing for API failures and missing data
