        # Forecasting logic - integrated into existing analyzer
        pass

# lib/reporting/weekly_reporter.py - EXTEND existing ReportGenerator
class ReportGenerator:  # EXISTING - DO NOT CREATE BusinessIntelligence
    def _apply_business_frameworks(self, analysis):  # EXISTING
        # Phase 2: ADD ROI calculation here - avoid duplication
