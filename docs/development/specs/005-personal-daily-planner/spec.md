## 🎯 **FEATURE OVERVIEW**

### **Problem Statement**
Engineering leaders need a strategic daily planning system that helps them:
- Set clear top priorities each morning aligned with organizational initiatives
- Track completion status throughout the day with strategic impact assessment
- Reflect on actual progress vs. planned priorities with L0/L1 initiative mapping
- Build consistent daily planning habits that drive organizational strategic objectives
- Ensure critical L0 (required) initiatives progress daily while maintaining L1 (strategic) focus

### **Solution Summary**
A **Strategic Personal Daily Planning Agent** that provides:
- **Morning Priority Session**: Interactive 3-5 priority setting with L0/L1 organizational alignment
- **Diego Persona Strategic Guidance**: Real-time analysis of priority alignment with organizational initiatives
- **End-of-Day Strategic Review**: Completion tracking + L0/L1 initiative progress assessment
- **Strategic Balance Monitoring**: Ensures optimal mix of required (L0) and strategic (L1) work
- **SQLite Persistence**: Local data storage with L0/L1 initiative mapping
- **Chat Integration**: Simple commands integrated with ClaudeDirector strategic personas

## 📋 **FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **Core Functionality**

#### **F1: Morning Priority Setting with Strategic Alignment**
- **Command**: `/daily-plan start` or `/daily-plan morning`
- **Flow**:
  1. Interactive session asking "What are your top priorities for today?"
  2. Diego persona analyzes priorities against L0/L1 organizational initiatives
  3. Strategic alignment feedback with recommendations
  4. Optional priority adjustment based on strategic guidance
- **Input**: 3-5 priority items (text-based) with L0/L1 initiative mapping
- **Storage**: Daily plan entry with timestamp, priorities, L0/L1 mappings, strategic balance score
- **Validation**: Prevent duplicate plans for same day, warn on strategic imbalance

#### **F2: End-of-Day Strategic Progress Review**
- **Command**: `/daily-plan review` or `/daily-plan evening`
- **Flow**:
  1. Display morning priorities with completion checkboxes and L0/L1 initiative mapping
  2. Ask "Which priorities did you complete today?"
  3. Diego persona analyzes L0/L1 initiative progress and strategic impact
  4. Ask "What other significant progress did you make?"
  5. Strategic effectiveness assessment with recommendations for tomorrow
- **Storage**: Update plan entry with completion status + L0/L1 progress + strategic insights
- **Analytics**: Calculate daily completion rate, strategic balance score, L0/L1 initiative progress

#### **F3: Strategic Historical Analysis**

## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **BaseManager Compliance & Existing Infrastructure Integration**
```python
# File: .claudedirector/lib/automation/daily_planning_manager.py
from ..core.base_manager import BaseManager, BaseManagerConfig, ManagerType
from ..automation.task_manager import StrategicTaskManager
from ..context_engineering.strategic_memory_manager import StrategicMemoryManager

class DailyPlanningManager(BaseManager):
    """
    🎯 Strategic Daily Planning Manager

    ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
    ✅ Extends existing StrategicTaskManager (DRY principle)
    ✅ Uses existing StrategicMemoryManager (BLOAT_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md)
    ✅ BaseManager pattern with proper BaseManagerConfig initialization
    ✅ Single Responsibility: Daily planning coordination only
    """

    def __init__(self, config_path: Optional[str] = None):
        # ✅ CORRECT BaseManager initialization pattern
        base_config = BaseManagerConfig(
            manager_name="daily_planning_manager",
            manager_type=ManagerType.AUTOMATION,
            enable_logging=True,
            enable_caching=True,
            enable_metrics=True,
        )

        super().__init__(base_config)

        # ✅ DRY: Leverage existing infrastructure
        self.task_manager = StrategicTaskManager(self.db_path)
        self.memory_manager = StrategicMemoryManager()

    def manage(self, operation: str, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """Execute daily planning operations using existing infrastructure"""
        if operation == "create_daily_plan":
            return self.task_manager.create_daily_task_plan(*args, **kwargs)
        elif operation == "review_daily_plan":
            return self.task_manager.review_daily_progress(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown operation: {operation}")
```

### **Database Integration - Leveraging Existing Infrastructure**
```python
# ✅ ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE: Use existing database systems
# No new schema needed - extends existing StrategicTaskManager database

class DailyPlanningManager(BaseManager):
    def _get_database_connection(self):
        """Use existing StrategicTaskManager database infrastructure"""
        return self.task_manager.get_connection()

    def _store_daily_plan(self, date: str, priorities: List[str], l0_mapping: Dict, l1_mapping: Dict):
        """Store daily plan using existing task management schema"""
        return self.task_manager.create_strategic_task_plan(
            date=date,
            tasks=priorities,
            initiative_mapping={'L0': l0_mapping, 'L1': l1_mapping},
            strategic_context=self._generate_strategic_context()
        )

    def _get_organizational_initiatives(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Load L0/L1 initiatives from existing strategic memory"""
        return self.memory_manager.get_strategic_initiatives()
```

### **Strategic Memory Integration**
```python
# ✅ DRY COMPLIANCE: Leverage existing strategic memory infrastructure
from ..context_engineering.strategic_memory_manager import StrategicMemoryManager

def _analyze_strategic_alignment(self, priorities: List[str]) -> StrategicAnalysis:
    """Use existing strategic analysis capabilities"""
    strategic_context = self.memory_manager.get_strategic_context()
    return self.memory_manager.analyze_priority_alignment(
        priorities=priorities,
        l0_initiatives=strategic_context['l0_initiatives'],
        l1_initiatives=strategic_context['l1_initiatives']
    )
```

### **Data Models - Extending Existing Types**
```python
# ✅ ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE: Extend existing ProcessingResult patterns
from ..core.types import ProcessingResult
from ..automation.task_manager import StrategicTaskManager
from ..context_engineering.strategic_memory_manager import StrategicMemoryManager

@dataclass
class DailyPlanningResult(ProcessingResult):
    """
    ✅ SOLID COMPLIANCE: Single responsibility for daily planning results
    ✅ DRY COMPLIANCE: Extends existing ProcessingResult pattern
    """
    daily_tasks: Optional[List[Dict]] = None  # From StrategicTaskManager
    strategic_analysis: Optional[Dict] = None  # From StrategicMemoryManager
    completion_stats: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None
    l0_l1_balance: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None

# ✅ NO NEW DATA MODELS NEEDED - Use existing infrastructure:
# - StrategicTaskManager.TaskData for task storage
# - StrategicMemoryManager.StrategicContext for L0/L1 initiatives
# - Existing ProcessingResult patterns for consistent return types
```

## 🎨 **USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN**

### **Morning Priority Session with Strategic Alignment**
```
🌅 Good morning! What are your top priorities for today?

1. > Review Q4 platform roadmap with stakeholders
2. > Complete technical debt assessment for UI components
3. > 1:1 meetings with senior engineers (3 scheduled)
4. > Strategic planning session prep for next week
5. > Debug production issue from Friday

✅ 5 priorities captured. Let me analyze strategic alignment...

🎯 Diego | Engineering Leadership
📊 Strategic Priority Alignment Analysis:

L0 INITIATIVES (Required - Must Progress):
• Platform Scalability Initiative → ✅ Matches Priority #1 (Q4 roadmap)
• Technical Debt Reduction → ✅ Matches Priority #2 (UI assessment)
• Team Development Program → ✅ Matches Priority #3 (1:1s)

L1 INITIATIVES (Strategic - High Impact):
• Cross-Team Coordination Excellence → ⚠️ Missing from today's priorities
• Engineering Process Innovation → ✅ Matches Priority #4 (strategic planning)

🔍 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
✅ Excellent L0 coverage (3/3 initiatives represented)
⚠️  Consider adding: "Stakeholder alignment session for Platform initiative"
💡 Priority #5 (production debug) is operational - ensure L0/L1 work isn't displaced

Strategic Balance: 60% L0, 20% L1, 20% Operational ✅ OPTIMAL

Would you like to:
A) Proceed with current priorities
B) Add cross-team coordination task
C) Adjust priority ordering for strategic impact

> A
