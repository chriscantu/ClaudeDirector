## 🎯 **FEATURE OVERVIEW**

### **Problem Statement**
Engineering leaders need a strategic daily planning system that helps them:
- Set clear top priorities each morning aligned with organizational initiatives
- Track completion status throughout the day with strategic impact assessment
- Reflect on actual progress vs. planned priorities with L0/L1 initiative mapping
- Build consistent daily planning habits that drive organizational strategic objectives
- Ensure critical L0 (required) initiatives progress daily while maintaining L1 (strategic) focus

### **Solution Summary**
A **Strategic Personal Daily Planning Agent** that provides:
- **Morning Priority Session**: Interactive 3-5 priority setting with L0/L1 organizational alignment
- **Diego Persona Strategic Guidance**: Real-time analysis of priority alignment with organizational initiatives
- **End-of-Day Strategic Review**: Completion tracking + L0/L1 initiative progress assessment
- **Strategic Balance Monitoring**: Ensures optimal mix of required (L0) and strategic (L1) work
- **SQLite Persistence**: Local data storage with L0/L1 initiative mapping
- **Chat Integration**: Simple commands integrated with ClaudeDirector strategic personas

## 📋 **FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **Core Functionality**

#### **F1: Morning Priority Setting with Strategic Alignment**
- **Command**: `/daily-plan start` or `/daily-plan morning`
- **Flow**:
  1. Interactive session asking "What are your top priorities for today?"
  2. Diego persona analyzes priorities against L0/L1 organizational initiatives
  3. Strategic alignment feedback with recommendations
  4. Optional priority adjustment based on strategic guidance
- **Input**: 3-5 priority items (text-based) with L0/L1 initiative mapping
- **Storage**: Daily plan entry with timestamp, priorities, L0/L1 mappings, strategic balance score
- **Validation**: Prevent duplicate plans for same day, warn on strategic imbalance

#### **F2: Individual Task Completion (Throughout Day)**
- **Commands**:
  - `"daily plan complete [task name]"` - Mark specific priority as done
  - `"daily plan done architecture review"` - Natural language completion
  - `"mark done team meeting"` - Alternative completion syntax
- **Flow**:
  1. Parse task name from natural language command
  2. Match against today's priorities (fuzzy matching for flexibility)
  3. Mark task as completed with timestamp
  4. Update strategic balance score based on L0/L1 initiative progress
  5. Provide completion confirmation with remaining priorities
- **Validation**: Only allow completion of today's planned priorities
- **Storage**: Update daily plan entry with completion status and timestamp per priority

#### **F3: End-of-Day Strategic Progress Review**
- **Command**: `/daily-plan review` or `/daily-plan evening`
- **Flow**:
  1. Display morning priorities with current completion status and L0/L1 initiative mapping
  2. Show completion rate and strategic balance achieved
  3. Diego persona analyzes L0/L1 initiative progress and strategic impact
  4. Ask "What other significant progress did you make?"
  5. Strategic effectiveness assessment with recommendations for tomorrow
- **Storage**: Update plan entry with completion status + L0/L1 progress + strategic insights
- **Analytics**: Calculate daily completion rate, strategic balance score, L0/L1 initiative progress

#### **F3: Strategic Historical Analysis**
- **Command**: `/daily-plan view [date]` or `/daily-plan history`
- **Display**: Recent daily plans with completion rates and L0/L1 initiative progress
- **Filtering**: By date range, completion status, L0/L1 initiative focus
- **Insights**: Weekly/monthly completion trends, strategic balance patterns, initiative progress tracking

#### **F4: Real-Time Priority Status Check**
- **Commands**:
  - `"daily plan status"` - Show current day progress with completion checkboxes
  - `"daily plan today"` - Quick status overview with strategic balance
- **Flow**:
  1. Display today's priorities with completion status (✅ done, ⏳ pending)
  2. Show completion percentage and strategic balance score
  3. Highlight remaining L0 (required) vs L1 (strategic) priorities
  4. Provide time-based recommendations if late in day
- **Output**: Progress dashboard with strategic guidance for remaining priorities

#### **F5: Quick Strategic Commands**
- `/daily-plan help` - Show available commands and L0/L1 initiative overview

### **Database Integration - Leveraging Existing Infrastructure**
```python
# ✅ ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE: Use existing database systems
# No new schema needed - extends existing StrategicTaskManager database

        )

    def _get_organizational_initiatives(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Load L0/L1 initiatives from existing strategic memory"""
        return self.memory_manager.get_strategic_initiatives()
```

### **Strategic Memory Integration**
```python
# ✅ DRY COMPLIANCE: Leverage existing strategic memory infrastructure
from ..context_engineering.strategic_memory_manager import StrategicMemoryManager

def _analyze_strategic_alignment(self, priorities: List[str]) -> StrategicAnalysis:
    """Use existing strategic analysis capabilities"""

        l1_initiatives=strategic_context['l1_initiatives']
    )
```

### **Data Models - Extending Existing Types**
```python
# ✅ ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE: Extend existing ProcessingResult patterns
from ..core.types import ProcessingResult
from ..automation.task_manager import StrategicTaskManager
from ..context_engineering.strategic_memory_manager import StrategicMemoryManager

@dataclass
class DailyPlanningResult(ProcessingResult):
    """
    ✅ SOLID COMPLIANCE: Single responsibility for daily planning results
    ✅ DRY COMPLIANCE: Extends existing ProcessingResult pattern
    """

    strategic_analysis: Optional[Dict] = None  # From StrategicMemoryManager
    completion_stats: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None
    l0_l1_balance: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None

# ✅ NO NEW DATA MODELS NEEDED - Use existing infrastructure:
# - StrategicTaskManager.TaskData for task storage
# - StrategicMemoryManager.StrategicContext for L0/L1 initiatives
# - Existing ProcessingResult patterns for consistent return types

## 🎨 **USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN**

### **Morning Priority Session with Strategic Alignment**
```
🌅 Good morning! What are your top priorities for today?

1. > Review Q4 platform roadmap with stakeholders
2. > Complete technical debt assessment for UI components
3. > 1:1 meetings with senior engineers (3 scheduled)
4. > Strategic planning session prep for next week
5. > Debug production issue from Friday

✅ 5 priorities captured. Let me analyze strategic alignment...

🎯 Diego | Engineering Leadership
📊 Strategic Priority Alignment Analysis:

L0 INITIATIVES (Required - Must Progress):
• Platform Scalability Initiative → ✅ Matches Priority #1 (Q4 roadmap)
• Technical Debt Reduction → ✅ Matches Priority #2 (UI assessment)
• Team Development Program → ✅ Matches Priority #3 (1:1s)

L1 INITIATIVES (Strategic - High Impact):
• Cross-Team Coordination Excellence → ⚠️ Missing from today's priorities
• Engineering Process Innovation → ✅ Matches Priority #4 (strategic planning)

🔍 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
✅ Excellent L0 coverage (3/3 initiatives represented)
⚠️  Consider adding: "Stakeholder alignment session for Platform initiative"
💡 Priority #5 (production debug) is operational - ensure L0/L1 work isn't displaced

Strategic Balance: 60% L0, 20% L1, 20% Operational ✅ OPTIMAL

Would you like to:
A) Proceed with current priorities
B) Add cross-team coordination task
C) Adjust priority ordering for strategic impact
