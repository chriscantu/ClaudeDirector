## 🎯 **FEATURE OVERVIEW**

### **Problem Statement**
Engineering leaders need a strategic daily planning system that helps them:
- Set clear top priorities each morning aligned with organizational initiatives
- Track completion status throughout the day with strategic impact assessment
- Reflect on actual progress vs. planned priorities with L0/L1 initiative mapping
- Build consistent daily planning habits that drive organizational strategic objectives
- Ensure critical L0 (required) initiatives progress daily while maintaining L1 (strategic) focus

### **Solution Summary**
A **Strategic Personal Daily Planning Agent** that provides:
- **Morning Priority Session**: Interactive 3-5 priority setting with L0/L1 organizational alignment
- **Diego Persona Strategic Guidance**: Real-time analysis of priority alignment with organizational initiatives
- **End-of-Day Strategic Review**: Completion tracking + L0/L1 initiative progress assessment
- **Strategic Balance Monitoring**: Ensures optimal mix of required (L0) and strategic (L1) work
- **SQLite Persistence**: Local data storage with L0/L1 initiative mapping
- **Chat Integration**: Simple commands integrated with ClaudeDirector strategic personas

## 📋 **FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **Core Functionality**

#### **F1: Morning Priority Setting with Strategic Alignment**
- **Command**: `/daily-plan start` or `/daily-plan morning`
- **Flow**:
  1. Interactive session asking "What are your top priorities for today?"
  2. Diego persona analyzes priorities against L0/L1 organizational initiatives
  3. Strategic alignment feedback with recommendations
  4. Optional priority adjustment based on strategic guidance
- **Input**: 3-5 priority items (text-based) with L0/L1 initiative mapping
- **Storage**: Daily plan entry with timestamp, priorities, L0/L1 mappings, strategic balance score
- **Validation**: Prevent duplicate plans for same day, warn on strategic imbalance

#### **F2: End-of-Day Strategic Progress Review**
- **Command**: `/daily-plan review` or `/daily-plan evening`
- **Flow**:
  1. Display morning priorities with completion checkboxes and L0/L1 initiative mapping
  2. Ask "Which priorities did you complete today?"
  3. Diego persona analyzes L0/L1 initiative progress and strategic impact
  4. Ask "What other significant progress did you make?"
  5. Strategic effectiveness assessment with recommendations for tomorrow
- **Storage**: Update plan entry with completion status + L0/L1 progress + strategic insights
- **Analytics**: Calculate daily completion rate, strategic balance score, L0/L1 initiative progress

#### **F3: Strategic Historical Analysis**
- **Command**: `/daily-plan view [date]` or `/daily-plan history`
- **Display**: Recent daily plans with completion rates and L0/L1 initiative progress
- **Filtering**: By date range, completion status, L0/L1 initiative focus
- **Insights**: Weekly/monthly completion trends, strategic balance patterns, initiative progress tracking

#### **F4: Quick Strategic Commands**
- `/daily-plan help` - Show available commands and L0/L1 initiative overview
- `/daily-plan today` - Show today's plan status with strategic alignment
- `/daily-plan stats` - Show completion statistics and L0/L1 initiative progress trends

## 🎨 **USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN**

### **Morning Priority Session with Strategic Alignment**
```
🌅 Good morning! What are your top priorities for today?

1. > Review Q4 platform roadmap with stakeholders
2. > Complete technical debt assessment for UI components
3. > 1:1 meetings with senior engineers (3 scheduled)
4. > Strategic planning session prep for next week
5. > Debug production issue from Friday

✅ 5 priorities captured. Let me analyze strategic alignment...

🎯 Diego | Engineering Leadership
📊 Strategic Priority Alignment Analysis:

L0 INITIATIVES (Required - Must Progress):
• Platform Scalability Initiative → ✅ Matches Priority #1 (Q4 roadmap)
• Technical Debt Reduction → ✅ Matches Priority #2 (UI assessment)
• Team Development Program → ✅ Matches Priority #3 (1:1s)

L1 INITIATIVES (Strategic - High Impact):
• Cross-Team Coordination Excellence → ⚠️ Missing from today's priorities
• Engineering Process Innovation → ✅ Matches Priority #4 (strategic planning)

🔍 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
✅ Excellent L0 coverage (3/3 initiatives represented)
⚠️  Consider adding: "Stakeholder alignment session for Platform initiative"
💡 Priority #5 (production debug) is operational - ensure L0/L1 work isn't displaced

Strategic Balance: 60% L0, 20% L1, 20% Operational ✅ OPTIMAL

Would you like to:
A) Proceed with current priorities
B) Add cross-team coordination task
C) Adjust priority ordering for strategic impact
