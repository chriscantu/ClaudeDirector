# Feature Specification: MCP Missing Modules Implementation

**Feature ID**: 001-mcp-missing-modules
**Feature Name**: MCP Missing Modules Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-17
**Author**: Martin | Platform Architecture
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

## üéØ **Feature Overview**

### **Problem Statement**
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) directory has 2 critical missing modules that are referenced in `__init__.py` but not implemented:
- `conversational_data_manager.py`
- `chat_context_manager.py`

This causes import failures throughout the system and breaks P0 test compliance, preventing proper MCP integration functionality.

### **Business Value**
- **Fix critical import failures** affecting MCP integration
- **Restore P0 test compliance** for continuous integration
- **Complete MCP analytics functionality** for strategic insights
- **Enable chat context management** for enhanced user experience

### **Success Metrics**
- ‚úÖ All MCP imports work without errors
- ‚úÖ P0 tests pass completely (40/40 - 100% success rate)
- ‚úÖ MCP analytics workflows fully functional
- ‚úÖ Chat context management operational
- ‚úÖ No performance regression introduced

## üèóÔ∏è **Functional Requirements**

### **FR1: Conversational Data Manager**
**As a** strategic user
**I want** conversational data analytics capabilities
**So that** I can gain insights from conversation history and persona usage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] ConversationalDataManager class implemented with query processing
- [ ] Support for 6 query types: history, persona usage, framework analytics, performance metrics, user engagement, strategic insights
- [ ] ConversationalQuery and DataResponse data structures
- [ ] Factory function `create_conversational_data_manager()`
- [ ] Performance metrics tracking and caching
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with fallback responses

### **FR2: Chat Context Manager**
**As a** user interacting with MCP chat features
**I want** proper context management across conversations
**So that** my interactions maintain state and provide coherent experiences

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] ChatContextManager class implemented with state management
- [ ] Support for multiple context scopes: session, conversation, global, persona-specific
- [ ] ChartContextState and ConversationContext data structures
- [ ] Factory function `create_chat_context_manager()`
- [ ] Context persistence and cleanup mechanisms
- [ ] Integration with existing MCP components

### **FR3: System Integration**
**As a** developer using MCP modules
**I want** seamless integration with existing components
**So that** the system works cohesively without breaking changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All imports in `mcp/__init__.py` work without errors
- [ ] Integration with ConversationalAnalyticsWorkflow
- [ ] Integration with DrillDownNavigationEngine and CrossChartLinkingEngine
- [ ] Support for InteractiveEnhancementAddon functionality
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing MCP usage

- Add comprehensive error handling and caching

### **Phase 2: Chat Context Manager** (IN PROGRESS)
- Implement ChatContextManager with state management
- Add context scope management (session, conversation, global, persona-specific)
- Implement context persistence and cleanup
- Add factory function and integration points

### **Phase 3: Integration & Validation** (PENDING)
- Update `__init__.py` imports verification
- Integration testing with existing components
- P0 test validation and performance benchmarking
- Documentation updates and code review
