# Personal Weekly Retrospective - Clean Implementation

## Problem Statement
Engineering leaders need a simple, personal reflection tool to capture weekly insights and track growth over time. Current bloated implementations violate architectural principles.

## Business Value
- **Personal Growth**: Structured reflection for continuous improvement
- **Pattern Recognition**: Historical data reveals recurring themes
- **Leadership Development**: Self-awareness through consistent practice

## Success Metrics
- **Simplicity**: <100 lines of implementation code
- **Adoption**: Weekly usage by engineering leaders
- **Retention**: 3+ months of consistent data

## Core Requirements

### 3-Question Framework
1. **"What went well this week?"** - Positive reinforcement
2. **"What could have gone better?"** - Growth opportunities
3. **"What will I focus on next week?"** - Forward-looking commitment

### Technical Requirements
- **SQLite Storage**: Persistent local data
- **Chat Interface**: Simple `/retrospective` command
- **BaseManager Pattern**: Follow PR #150 architecture
- **Zero Dependencies**: No JIRA, no business intelligence, no external APIs

## Scope Boundaries

### IN SCOPE ✅
- Personal reflection only
- 3-question format
- Local SQLite storage
- Simple chat commands
- Historical data viewing

### OUT OF SCOPE ❌
- Business intelligence
- Team retrospectives
- JIRA integration
- Advanced analytics
- Visual dashboards
- Multi-user features

## Architecture Alignment
- **Follow PR #150**: BaseManager inheritance, YAML config, DRY principles
- **BLOAT_PREVENTION**: <100 lines, zero code duplication
- **Single Responsibility**: Personal reflection only
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Reuse database, config, and chat patterns

## Implementation Size Target
- **Main Implementation**: <80 lines
- **Configuration**: <20 lines
- **Tests**: <50 lines
- **Total**: <150 lines (excluding documentation)

This specification ensures we return to the clean, focused approach that made PR #150 successful.
