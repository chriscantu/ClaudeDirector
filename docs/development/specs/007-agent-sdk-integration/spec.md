# Feature Specification: Agent SDK Selective Integration

**Feature ID**: 007-agent-sdk-integration
**Feature Name**: Claude Agent SDK Selective Integration
**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Author**: Martin | Platform Architecture
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

---

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**

### **Problem Statement**
The Claude Agent SDK was recently released with new patterns for agent development, MCP integration, and performance optimization. We need to evaluate whether to:
1. Fully migrate to Agent SDK
2. Ignore SDK completely
3. Selectively integrate beneficial patterns

Based on comprehensive analysis (ADR-018), **full migration would destroy our unique value** (personas, transparency, 8-layer context) while solving problems we don't have.

### **Business Value**
- **10-20% performance improvement** via SDK-inspired prompt caching
- **Enhanced error resilience** with SDK retry patterns
- **Future-proof MCP integration** ensuring SDK compatibility
- **Zero risk to differentiators** - preserves personas, transparency, strategic context
- **Cost effective** - $50-100K vs $800K-1.2M for full migration

### **Success Metrics**
- ✅ >10% latency reduction in prompt assembly
- ✅ >95% error recovery success rate
- ✅ 100% MCP SDK compatibility validated
- ✅ All 40 P0 tests passing throughout
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to user-facing features
- ✅ Persona routing 100% preserved
- ✅ Transparency system 100% functional
