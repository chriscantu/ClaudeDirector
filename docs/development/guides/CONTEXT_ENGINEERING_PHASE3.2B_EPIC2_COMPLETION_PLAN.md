## Implementation Architecture

### **CollaborationScorer Component Structure**
```python
class CollaborationScorer:
    """
    Production-ready collaboration success prediction with ensemble ML models
    Integrates with existing MLPatternEngine foundation
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.ensemble_models = self._initialize_ensemble()
        self.feature_extractor = TeamFeatureExtractor()  # From existing foundation
        self.risk_calculator = RiskAssessmentEngine()

    def predict_collaboration_success(self, team_data: TeamCollaborationOutcome) -> CollaborationPrediction:
        """
        Primary interface for collaboration success prediction
        Returns: CollaborationPrediction with confidence intervals and risk factors
        """

    def calculate_risk_score(self, prediction: CollaborationPrediction) -> RiskAssessment:
        """
        Advanced risk scoring with multi-factor analysis
        Returns: Detailed risk assessment with mitigation recommendations
        """
```

### **Ensemble ML Model Architecture**

- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical confidence bounds for all predictions
- **Mitigation Recommendations**: Actionable guidance based on risk factor analysis

## P0 Test Requirements (Following TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md)

### **Mandatory P0 Test Coverage**
According to our Unified Testing Architecture, all new features require P0 test coverage:

#### **CollaborationScorer P0 Test Suite**
```yaml
# Addition to .claudedirector/tests/p0_enforcement/p0_test_definitions.yaml
- name: "CollaborationScorer P0"
  test_module: ".claudedirector/tests/regression/p0_blocking/test_collaboration_scorer_p0.py"
  critical_level: "BLOCKING"
  timeout_seconds: 300
  description: "CollaborationScorer must provide 85%+ collaboration success prediction accuracy with <5s response time"
  failure_impact: "Collaboration prediction fails, ensemble ML scoring broken, strategic decision support unreliable"
  business_impact: "Strategic planning loses predictive capability, team management becomes reactive instead of proactive"
  introduced_version: "v2.12.0"
  owner: "martin"
```

#### **Required Test Cases**
1. **Ensemble Model Integration**: Verify all ML models integrate correctly
2. **Prediction Accuracy**: Validate 85%+ success prediction accuracy
3. **Performance Requirements**: Ensure <5s response time for scoring
4. **Risk Assessment**: Verify risk factor calculation and confidence intervals
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Test behavior when ML dependencies unavailable
6. **Feature Integration**: Validate integration with existing MLPatternEngine
7. **Data Validation**: Ensure robust input validation and error handling
8. **Confidence Scoring**: Verify statistical confidence intervals accuracy

### **Testing Implementation Strategy**
Following `TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md` principles:
- **Single Source of Truth**: All tests defined in `p0_test_definitions.yaml`
- **Environment Parity**: Identical test execution local/CI through unified runner
- **Self-Validating**: Architecture validates its own consistency
