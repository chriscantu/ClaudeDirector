# Constitutional Development Prompts Guide

**GitHub Spec-Kit constitutional development process and prompt templates for strategic development.**

---

## 🎯 **Overview**

This guide provides the correct prompt structures for triggering GitHub Spec-Kit constitutional development process, ensuring full compliance with our strategic development framework.

## 🏆 **Primary Prompt Structure**

### **Standard Constitutional Development Prompt (Simplified)**

```
--constitutional-development

[Your development request here]

Please follow the GitHub Spec-Kit constitutional development process:
1. Create executable specification using .claudedirector/templates/spec-template.md
2. Apply Sequential Thinking methodology (6-step process)
3. Ensure PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md and BLOAT_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md compliance
4. Include strategic framework integration (Team Topologies, WRAP, Capital Allocation)
5. Validate constitutional compliance (max 3 projects, max 5 components)
6. Apply TDD workflow (RED-GREEN-Refactor)
7. Include P0 testing requirements
```

**🔧 Automatic MCP Activation**: Sequential Thinking (`--think-hard`) and Context7 (`--c7`) MCP servers activate automatically when using `--constitutional-development`.

### **Advanced Override Options**

#### **Explicit MCP Control**
```
--think-hard --c7 --constitutional-development

[Your development request here]

Please follow the GitHub Spec-Kit constitutional development process:
1. Create executable specification using .claudedirector/templates/spec-template.md
2. Apply Sequential Thinking methodology (6-step process)
3. Ensure PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md and BLOAT_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md compliance
4. Include strategic framework integration (Team Topologies, WRAP, Capital Allocation)
5. Validate constitutional compliance (max 3 projects, max 5 components)
6. Apply TDD workflow (RED-GREEN-Refactor)
7. Include P0 testing requirements
```

#### **Sequential Only**
```
--sequential-only --constitutional-development

[Your development request here]

Please follow the GitHub Spec-Kit constitutional development process:
1. Create executable specification using .claudedirector/templates/spec-template.md
2. Apply Sequential Thinking methodology (6-step process)

7. Include P0 testing requirements
```

#### **No MCP Enhancement**
```
--no-mcp --constitutional-development

[Your development request here]

Please follow the GitHub Spec-Kit constitutional development process:
1. Create executable specification using .claudedirector/templates/spec-template.md
2. Apply Sequential Thinking methodology (6-step process)
3. Ensure PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md and BLOAT_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md compliance
4. Include strategic framework integration (Team Topologies, WRAP, Capital Allocation)

## 🔄 **Subsequent Request Patterns**

### **Pattern A: Continuation (Recommended)**
```
Continue with the next component implementation
```

### **Pattern B: Context-Aware**
```
Apply the same constitutional process to [new request]
```

### **Pattern C: Explicit Reference**
```
Using the same constitutional development process, [new request]
```

### **Pattern D: Sequential Steps**
```
Next step: [specific next action]
```

### **Pattern E: Context Switching**
```
Switch to [new context] using constitutional development
```

**🔧 Automatic Context**: Subsequent requests automatically maintain constitutional context and MCP activation without requiring repeated flags.

## 📋 **Prompt Components Explained**

### **1. Constitutional Triggers**
- **`--constitutional-development`** - Primary trigger for Spec-Kit constitutional process (automatic MCP activation)
- **`--think-hard --c7`** - Explicit MCP control for advanced users
- **`--sequential-only`** - Sequential Thinking MCP only
- **`--no-mcp`** - Constitutional process without MCP enhancement

### **2. Mandatory Process Elements**
- **Executable Specification** - Uses `.claudedirector/templates/spec-template.md`
- **Sequential Thinking** - 6-step methodology application
- **Constitutional Compliance** - Simplicity constraints and quality standards
- **Strategic Intelligence** - Framework integration and executive validation

### **3. Quality Enforcement**
- **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Architectural compliance
- **BLOAT_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md** - Duplication prevention
- **P0 Testing** - Zero tolerance for failures
- **DRY/SOLID** - Code quality standards
