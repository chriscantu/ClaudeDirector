## Technical Architecture

### **New Components**

#### **Analytics Engine (`analytics_engine.py`)**
```python
class AnalyticsEngine:
    """Advanced analytics and predictive intelligence for strategic decisions"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.framework_analyzer = FrameworkPatternAnalyzer()
        self.initiative_scorer = InitiativeHealthScorer()
        self.stakeholder_analyzer = StakeholderEngagementAnalyzer()
        self.learning_engine = OrganizationalLearningEngine()
```

#### **Framework Intelligence (`framework_intelligence.py`)**
```python
class FrameworkPatternAnalyzer:
    """Analyzes framework usage patterns and predicts optimal applications"""

    def predict_optimal_framework(self, context: str) -> FrameworkRecommendation:
        """Predict best framework for given strategic context"""
```

#### **Initiative Scoring (`initiative_health.py`)**
```python
class InitiativeHealthScorer:
    """Scores initiative health and predicts risks"""

    def calculate_health_score(self, initiative: Initiative) -> HealthScore:
        """Multi-factor scoring with risk prediction"""
```

### **Integration Points**
- **AdvancedContextEngine**: Enhanced with analytics capabilities

## Success Metrics

### **Quantitative Goals**
- **Framework Selection Efficiency**: 60% reduction in selection time
- **Initiative Risk Detection**: 2-week advance warning capability
- **Strategic Decision Quality**: 40% improvement in outcome predictability
- **Organizational Learning**: 30% faster pattern recognition

### **Quality Gates**
- **P0 Tests**: All analytics features must have blocking P0 tests
- **Performance**: <2s response time for all analytics operations
- **Accuracy**: >85% prediction accuracy for framework recommendations
