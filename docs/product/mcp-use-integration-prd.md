# MCP-Use Integration: Product Requirements Document
*Collaborative Strategic Analysis by Alvaro, Rachel, and Martin*

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

### **Project Objective**
Integrate [mcp-use library](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use) to enable ClaudeDirector personas to connect with MCP servers (Context7, Sequential, Magic) while maintaining our zero-setup principle and conversation quality.

### **Business Rationale**
- **Development ROI**: 33-50% time savings (1-2 weeks) vs. custom MCP implementation
- **Enhanced Zero-Setup**: Sandbox execution potentially improves our core value proposition
- **Competitive Advantage**: Faster time-to-market for MCP-native strategic AI positioning
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proven library vs. greenfield development with maintained fallback strategy

### **Success Criteria**
```yaml
Technical: Zero regression + 3-5 second enhanced responses + 99.5% uptime
Business: Faster delivery + stronger zero-setup story + market differentiation
User Experience: Seamless integration + maintained persona authenticity + organic discovery
```

## üö® **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**

#### **MEDIUM: External Dependency Management**
```yaml
Risk: mcp-use library or MCP server package unavailability
Impact: Enhanced capabilities unavailable, potential user disappointment
Mitigation: 
  - Comprehensive graceful degradation to standard personas
  - Clear user communication about enhanced vs. standard capabilities
  - Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascade failures
  - HTTP fallback for servers that don't support STDIO
  - Local package caching for offline operation
Probability: LOW (no external service dependencies, local execution)
```

#### **MEDIUM: Performance Impact**
```yaml
Risk: Enhanced responses too slow, degrading conversation experience
Impact: User frustration, abandonment of enhanced features
Mitigation:
  - Conservative performance SLA (5 seconds) with timeout fallback
  - Intelligent caching for common patterns and frameworks
  - Async processing to prevent blocking
  - Progressive enhancement only when clear value added
Probability: LOW (mcp-use reports 3-5 second typical response times)
```

#### **MEDIUM: Integration Complexity**
```yaml
Risk: MCP integration breaks existing conversation patterns
Impact: Regression in core functionality, user confusion
Mitigation:
  - Comprehensive testing of all existing workflows
  - Feature flag deployment with gradual rollout

Probability: LOW (evolutionary enhancement of existing architecture)
```

### **Business Risks**

#### **LOW: Market Timing**
```yaml
Risk: MCP ecosystem evolves faster than our integration
Impact: Integration becomes outdated or incompatible
Mitigation:
  - mcp-use library abstracts protocol details
  - Modular architecture enables server addition/updates
  - Active monitoring of MCP ecosystem developments
  - Participation in MCP community for early awareness
```

#### **LOW: User Adoption**
```yaml
Risk: Users don't discover or value enhanced capabilities
Impact: Development investment doesn't drive adoption growth
Mitigation:
  - Organic discovery through natural conversation flow
  - Clear value demonstration when enhancements provide benefit
  - Progressive disclosure prevents overwhelming casual users
  - Success metrics tracking for optimization
