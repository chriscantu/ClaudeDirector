# MCP-Use Integration: User Stories
*Development Requirements for Feature Implementation*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Epic Overview**

**Epic Goal**: Enable ClaudeDirector personas to access external MCP servers (Context7, Sequential, Magic) through transparent integration using mcp-use library while maintaining zero-setup principle.

**Business Value**: Transform ClaudeDirector from enhanced chat to professional strategic analysis system with systematic frameworks and proven methodologies.
