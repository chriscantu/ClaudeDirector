# Phase 2: Dynamic Persona Activation - User Story Requirements

**Product Owner**: Alvaro (Sr Director Product Strategy)
**Epic**: Intelligent Persona Auto-Activation
**Business Value**: Eliminate friction in director-AI interactions, increase adoption by 3x
**User Personas**: Engineering Directors across Mobile, Product, Platform, Infrastructure, Data, Backend domains

## ðŸŽ¯ **Executive Summary**

**Vision**: Transform ClaudeDirector from a tool requiring technical activation commands to an intelligent assistant that understands director context and automatically provides domain-appropriate strategic guidance.

**Business Problem**: Current manual persona activation (`@persona-name`) creates adoption friction - directors must learn and remember technical syntax rather than focusing on strategic decisions.

**Success Metrics**:
- **Adoption Velocity**: 3x faster director onboarding (from 30min â†’ 10min)
- **Usage Frequency**: 2x increase in daily interactions
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5/5 rating for "feels like talking to a domain expert"
- **Activation Accuracy**: 90%+ correct persona selection without manual intervention
