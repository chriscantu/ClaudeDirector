## üéØ **THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL TEAM TYPES**

### **1. STREAM-ALIGNED TEAMS**
**Purpose**: Aligned to a flow of work from a segment of the business domain
- **Focus**: End-to-end delivery of business value
- **Size**: 5-9 people (cognitive load limit)
- **Autonomy**: High - can deliver features independently
- **Lifespan**: Long-lived, stable teams

**Engineering Applications:**
- Product feature teams (mobile app, web platform, API)
- Customer-facing service teams
- Business domain teams (payments, user management, analytics)

**Success Indicators:**
- Can deploy independently without coordination
- Clear ownership of business outcomes
- Fast flow from idea to production

### **2. PLATFORM TEAMS**
**Purpose**: Enable stream-aligned teams to deliver with substantial autonomy
- **Focus**: Reduce cognitive load for stream-aligned teams
- **Products**: Internal platforms, tools, infrastructure
- **Customers**: Other engineering teams (internal)
- **Lifespan**: Long-lived, evolves with needs

**Engineering Applications:**
- Developer platform teams (CI/CD, deployment, monitoring)
- Data platform teams (analytics, ML infrastructure)
- Security platform teams (compliance, auth, secrets)
- Infrastructure platform teams (cloud, networking, databases)

**Success Indicators:**
- Stream-aligned teams can self-serve
- Reduced time-to-market for business features
- High adoption and satisfaction from internal customers

### **3. ENABLING TEAMS**
**Purpose**: Help stream-aligned teams overcome obstacles and discover missing capabilities
- **Focus**: Coaching, mentoring, research, skill development
- **Interaction**: Temporary, facilitating mode
- **Expertise**: Deep specialists in specific domains
- **Lifespan**: Project-based or temporary assignments

**Engineering Applications:**
- Architecture guidance teams
- DevOps transformation teams
- Security consulting teams
- Performance optimization specialists
- Technology research teams

**Success Indicators:**
- Stream-aligned teams gain new capabilities
- Knowledge transfer is effective and sticky
- Teams become self-sufficient in new areas

### **4. COMPLICATED-SUBSYSTEM TEAMS**
**Purpose**: Build and maintain parts of the system requiring specialist knowledge
- **Focus**: High-complexity subsystems needing deep expertise
- **Size**: Smaller, specialist teams
- **Interaction**: Provides services to stream-aligned teams
- **Lifespan**: Long-lived for specific subsystem

**Engineering Applications:**
- Video encoding/processing systems
- Machine learning model teams
- Mathematical computation engines
- Real-time trading systems
- Cryptographic implementation teams

**Success Indicators:**
- Complex subsystem is reliable and performant
- Clear API boundaries for other teams
- Expertise is concentrated and effective

## üîÑ **TEAM INTERACTION MODES**

### **COLLABORATION MODE**
**When**: Teams work together on shared problems
- **Duration**: Temporary (weeks to months)
- **Purpose**: Rapid discovery, innovation, learning
- **Example**: Platform team + stream-aligned team building new capability

### **X-AS-A-SERVICE MODE**
**When**: One team provides something "as a service" to another
- **Duration**: Ongoing
- **Purpose**: Clear boundaries, reduced cognitive load
- **Example**: Platform team provides deployment pipeline to stream-aligned teams

### **FACILITATING MODE**
**When**: One team helps another become more effective
- **Duration**: Temporary (until capability transfer complete)
- **Purpose**: Skill development, capability building
- **Example**: Enabling team helping stream-aligned team adopt new technology

## üéØ **COGNITIVE LOAD MANAGEMENT**

### **TYPES OF COGNITIVE LOAD:**

**INTRINSIC LOAD**: Fundamental aspects of the problem space
- **Cannot be reduced** - core complexity of the business domain
- **Example**: Understanding payment processing rules and regulations

**EXTRANEOUS LOAD**: Environment and context where work happens
- **CAN be reduced** - tooling, process, platform complexity
- **Example**: Complex deployment processes, unclear interfaces

**GERMANE LOAD**: Processing, construction, and automation of knowledge
- **SHOULD be optimized** - learning and capability building
- **Example**: Understanding new architectural patterns, business context

### **COGNITIVE LOAD OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:**

**MINIMIZE EXTRANEOUS LOAD:**
- Provide excellent developer platforms and tooling
- Clear APIs and service boundaries
- Self-service capabilities for common operations
- Standardized deployment and monitoring

**OPTIMIZE INTRINSIC LOAD:**
- Align teams to business domains (domain-driven design)
- Keep teams small (5-9 people maximum)
- Maintain stable team membership
- Clear ownership boundaries

**ENHANCE GERMANE LOAD:**
- Provide learning opportunities and skill development
- Enable teams to innovate within their domain
- Regular architecture and technology evolution
- Cross-team knowledge sharing

## üìä **TEAM TOPOLOGY ASSESSMENT**

### **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:**

**TEAM BOUNDARIES:**
- How do teams currently hand off work to each other?
- Where do delays and bottlenecks occur?
- Which teams are frequently blocked by other teams?
- What work requires coordination across multiple teams?

**COGNITIVE LOAD EVALUATION:**
- How many different technologies/platforms does each team work with?
- How often do teams need to understand other teams' systems?
- What percentage of time is spent on business logic vs. infrastructure?
- How long does it take to onboard new team members?

**COMMUNICATION PATTERNS:**
- Which teams communicate most frequently?
- What communication happens through code/APIs vs. meetings?
- Where do misunderstandings and conflicts occur?
- How does information flow through the organization?

### **FUTURE STATE DESIGN:**

**TEAM TYPE MAPPING:**
1. **Identify stream-aligned teams**: Map to business value streams
2. **Design platform teams**: Address common needs across stream-aligned teams
3. **Plan enabling teams**: Temporary teams for capability development
4. **Evaluate complicated-subsystem teams**: High-complexity areas needing specialists

**INTERACTION MODE PLANNING:**
- **Default to X-as-a-Service**: Clear boundaries, reduced dependencies
- **Use Collaboration temporarily**: For innovation and rapid learning
- **Apply Facilitating mode**: For capability transfer and skill development

## üéØ **CURSOR ACTIVATION PATTERNS**

**When user mentions:**
- "Team structure", "org design", "team boundaries"
- "Platform team", "enabling team", "stream-aligned"
- "Cognitive load", "team autonomy", "dependencies"
- "Communication patterns", "team interactions"
- "Software delivery", "team performance"

**Combine with personas:**
- **Rachel**: Organizational design and people impact
- **Diego**: Engineering performance and team effectiveness
