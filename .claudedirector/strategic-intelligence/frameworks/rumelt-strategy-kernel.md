# üéØ Rumelt Strategy Kernel Framework

**Strategic Foundation for Engineering Leadership Decisions**

---

## üìã **FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW**

**Source**: "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt
**Application**: Platform strategy, competitive analysis, resource allocation decisions
**Best For**: Engineering directors making strategic platform and organizational investments

---

## üîç **THE THREE COMPONENTS**

### **1. DIAGNOSIS**
**Define the Challenge**
- What is the real problem or opportunity?
- What are the critical constraints and bottlenecks?
- What forces are at work in this situation?

**Engineering Leadership Applications:**
- Platform adoption challenges
- Technical debt accumulation patterns
- Team performance bottlenecks
- Competitive technical positioning

### **2. GUIDING POLICY**
**Overall Approach to Deal with the Challenge**
- What is our approach to overcome the obstacles?
- What trade-offs will we make?
- What will we NOT do?

**Engineering Leadership Applications:**
- Platform investment philosophy (build vs buy vs partner)
- Technical architecture principles
- Team organization approach
- Resource allocation priorities

### **3. COHERENT ACTIONS**
**Coordinated Steps to Implement the Policy**
- What specific actions will we take?
- How do these actions reinforce each other?
- What resources will we commit?

**Engineering Leadership Applications:**
- Specific platform development roadmap
- Team restructuring plan
- Technical migration strategy
- Vendor partnership execution

## üéØ **APPLICATION PATTERNS**

### **PLATFORM STRATEGY ANALYSIS**
```
DIAGNOSIS:
- Multiple teams building similar infrastructure
- 40% of engineering time spent on undifferentiated work
- Slow time-to-market for new features

GUIDING POLICY:
- Build internal platform to eliminate redundant work
- Focus teams on business-differentiating features
- Accept initial platform investment cost for long-term velocity

COHERENT ACTIONS:
- Form dedicated platform team by Q2
- Migrate payment processing to platform by Q3
- Establish platform adoption metrics and incentives
- Create platform roadmap aligned with business priorities
```

### **TECHNICAL DEBT STRATEGY**
```
DIAGNOSIS:
- Legacy system causing 60% of production incidents
- New feature development 3x slower than competitors
- Engineering morale declining due to maintenance burden

GUIDING POLICY:
- Strategic rewrite of core system over 18 months
- Maintain feature velocity during transition
- Invest in engineering experience and productivity

COHERENT ACTIONS:
- Dedicated modernization team with protected time
- Incremental migration strategy with rollback capability
- Enhanced monitoring and incident response during transition
- Skills development program for modern technology stack
```

## üí° **STRATEGIC QUESTIONS FOR DIAGNOSIS**

### **PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION:**
- What symptoms are we seeing repeatedly?
- What underlying forces are creating these symptoms?
- What constraints are preventing us from solving this?
- What would happen if we don't address this challenge?

### **COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:**
- How are competitors addressing similar challenges?
- What advantages do we have that competitors lack?
- What disadvantages must we overcome?
- Where can we create sustainable competitive advantage?

### **RESOURCE REALITY:**
- What resources do we actually have available?
- What are our real constraints (time, people, budget, skills)?
- What trade-offs are we willing to make?
- What capabilities must we build vs. buy vs. partner?

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE**

### **DIAGNOSIS PHASE:**
1. **Gather Evidence**: Metrics, stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis
2. **Identify Patterns**: What keeps showing up as root cause?
3. **Name the Challenge**: Clear, specific problem statement
4. **Validate Understanding**: Test diagnosis with key stakeholders

### **GUIDING POLICY PHASE:**
1. **Define Approach**: How will we generally tackle this challenge?
2. **Set Boundaries**: What will we NOT do? What trade-offs will we accept?
3. **Establish Principles**: What decision-making criteria will guide us?
4. **Gain Alignment**: Ensure leadership commitment to the approach

### **COHERENT ACTIONS PHASE:**
1. **Plan Sequence**: What order will maximize momentum and learning?
2. **Allocate Resources**: People, budget, time commitments
3. **Define Success**: Metrics and milestones for tracking progress
4. **Execute with Discipline**: Maintain focus despite competing priorities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMMON STRATEGY MISTAKES TO AVOID**

### **BAD STRATEGY CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Fluff**: Generic vision statements without specific diagnosis
- **Failure to Face the Challenge**: Avoiding difficult trade-offs
- **Mistaking Goals for Strategy**: "Increase platform adoption by 50%" is not strategy
- **Bad Strategic Objectives**: Unrealistic or internally inconsistent goals

### **STRATEGIC THINKING PITFALLS:**
- Trying to be everything to everyone
- Copying competitors without understanding context
- Setting goals without addressing obstacles
- Creating strategies that require unrealistic resources

## üéØ **CURSOR ACTIVATION PATTERNS**

**When user mentions:**
- "Platform strategy" ‚Üí Apply diagnosis to platform challenges
- "Technical debt" ‚Üí Use framework for systematic debt strategy
- "Competitive positioning" ‚Üí Leverage for market analysis
- "Resource allocation" ‚Üí Apply for investment prioritization
- "Team organization" ‚Üí Use for organizational strategy

**Combine with personas:**
- **Alvaro**: Business impact and ROI analysis
- **Martin**: Technical architecture and platform implications
- **Rachel**: Organizational and people impact

The Rumelt Strategy Kernel provides rigorous strategic thinking for complex engineering leadership challenges, ensuring decisions are grounded in reality and supported by coherent action plans.
