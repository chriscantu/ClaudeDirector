# Phase 7: Agent SDK Selective Integration - Progress Tracking

**Feature ID**: 007-agent-sdk-integration
**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-10-08
**Est. Completion**: TBD

---

## 🎯 Overview

Selectively integrating beneficial Claude Agent SDK patterns while preserving ClaudeDirector's unique value proposition (personas, transparency, 8-layer context).

### Business Value
- **10-20% performance improvement** via SDK-inspired prompt caching
- **Enhanced error resilience** with SDK retry patterns
- **Future-proof MCP integration** ensuring SDK compatibility
- **Cost effective**: $50-100K vs $800K-1.2M for full migration

## 📝 Notes

### Key Decisions
- Using selective integration approach (not full migration)
- Preserving all unique value differentiators
- Focusing on performance and resilience enhancements

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: SDK patterns conflict with existing patterns
  - **Mitigation**: Compatibility layer + thorough testing

- **Risk**: Performance regression
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive benchmarking before/after

- **Risk**: Breaking changes to P0 features
  - **Mitigation**: P0 tests run continuously, zero tolerance for failures
