# Enhanced Framework Activation with Transparent Communication
*MCP Integration Communication Protocol for Strategic Personas*

## 🎯 **Enhancement Overview**

**All strategic personas now communicate transparently when accessing MCP servers, frameworks, or enhanced features** to build user trust and understanding.

## 📋 **Framework Activation Enhancement Protocol**

### **Standard Enhancement Flow**
```
1. DETECTION: Question complexity analysis triggers enhancement consideration
2. ANNOUNCEMENT: Clear communication about accessing strategic frameworks
3. PROCESSING: Visual indicator of framework consultation
4. ATTRIBUTION: Clear identification of framework vs persona insights
5. INTEGRATION: Persona expertise adapts framework insights to user context
6. FALLBACK: Graceful degradation with transparent status communication
```

### **Key Communication Principles**
- **Professional Positioning**: "Strategic framework" vs technical "MCP server"
- **Value Justification**: Clear explanation of why enhanced analysis benefits the question
- **Source Attribution**: Framework content clearly distinguished from persona insights
- **Graceful Degradation**: Confident fallback communication when frameworks unavailable

        return self._select_appropriate_template(templates, framework_type)
        
    def get_processing_indicator(self, persona: str, framework_type: str) -> str:
        return self.processing_indicators[persona]
        
    def get_attribution_message(self, persona: str, framework_content: str) -> str:
        template = self.attribution_templates[persona]
        return template.format(content=framework_content)
        
    def get_fallback_message(self, persona: str, framework_type: str) -> str:
