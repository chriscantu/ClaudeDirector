# STRATEGIC-TOOLS.md - Claude Flow MCP Integration Framework

Strategic tool integration layer for SuperClaude Director-level intelligence enhancement.

## Integration Architecture

### **Core Principles**
- **SuperClaude Preservation**: Enhance existing workflows, don't replace optimization
- **Selective Activation**: Tools activate only when strategic value exceeds cost
- **Executive Focus**: All tools must demonstrate VP/SLT level value
- **Memory Enhancement**: Strategic memory provides context for tool intelligence
- **Cost Optimization**: Maintain 60-70% savings through intelligent activation

## Cost Optimization Integration

### **Selective Activation Logic**
```yaml
Cost-Benefit Activation Rules:
  Executive Context (Always Activate):
    - VP/SLT preparation and strategic presentations
    - Investment decisions >$100K with board impact
    - Crisis management and incident response
    - Strategic planning with organizational impact

  Strategic Value Threshold (Context Dependent):
    - Platform assessment: Activate if adoption issues detected
    - Cross-team coordination: Activate if dependency conflicts >3
    - Budget planning: Activate if variance >10% or ROI modeling needed
    - Compliance/audit: Activate if risk level elevated

  Cost Monitoring:
    - Track token usage per tool per command execution
    - Calculate cost per strategic insight generated
    - Monitor ROI on tool activation decisions
    - Alert if cost optimization targets exceeded (>30% increase)
```

### **Token Usage Optimization**
```yaml
Intelligent Caching:
  - Cache tool outputs for similar contexts within 24-hour window
  - Reuse analytical insights for related strategic queries
  - Share tool intelligence across commands when applicable
  - Store successful analysis patterns for future optimization

Batch Processing:
  - Combine multiple tool queries when context overlaps
  - Process related analytics in single tool execution
  - Optimize tool parameter passing for efficiency
  - Coordinate tool execution to minimize redundant analysis
