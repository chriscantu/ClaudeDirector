# Note: All test classes and methods have been removed since this entire test module
# is superseded by Context Engineering Phase 2.1 workspace integration tests.
# The legacy functionality tested here is no longer relevant as:
# - WorkspaceFileHandler was replaced by context_engineering/workspace_integration.py
# - PersonaFileIntegration was deprecated and removed
# - Phase 2 file management is now handled by Context Engineering multi-layer system
