**Strategic Integration**:

- Cross-product consistency enabling brand cohesion

**ROI Metrics for Executives**:
- 40% faster feature delivery (measured across 8 product teams)
- 60% reduction in design debt accumulation
- Legal compliance protection (accessibility lawsuits cost $500K+ average)

**Stakeholder Value Propositions**:
- Product Teams: Faster delivery, consistent UX
- Engineering Teams: Reusable components, less custom implementation
- Executive Team: Risk mitigation, measurable efficiency gains, competitive advantage

**Coalition Building**: Product managers are natural advocates. Need to position design system as business enabler, not design preference.""",
