Let me stress-test this platform investment approach systematically...

**Strategic Framework Application**: Capital Allocation Framework + Stakeholder Mapping

**ROI Analysis**:
- Developer productivity: 25% efficiency gain ($2.1M annually)
- Cross-team platform capabilities: Reduces 40% duplicate engineering work
- Technical debt prevention: Avoids 15% velocity degradation

**Stakeholder Coalition Strategy**:
- Platform Advocates: VP Engineering, Senior Director, Distinguished Engineer
- Key Persuasion Targets: Finance Director (needs ROI clarity), Engineering Director (budget pressure)
- Platform Opponents: Product-focused VP (skip-level delivery focus), Product Director (100% delivery focus)

**Q1 Investment Recommendation**:
1. **Phase 1** (Month 1): Stakeholder alignment sessions + ROI validation
2. **Phase 2** (Month 2): Platform foundation + developer tooling
3. **Phase 3** (Month 3): Cross-team integration + success metrics

This approach balances immediate delivery pressure with long-term platform value creation.""",

Great question! Let me approach this systematically for maximum flexibility...

**Design System Architecture Strategy**:

**Technology-Agnostic Foundation**:
- Design tokens (JSON/CSS custom properties) - framework independent
- Figma component library with comprehensive specifications
- Storybook documentation with framework-specific examples

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Core Layer**: Design tokens + CSS-only components
2. **React Layer**: Current component implementations
3. **Vue Layer**: Future implementations using same design tokens
4. **Bridge Layer**: Shared utilities and design system logic

**Migration Path**:
- Phase 1: Extract design tokens from React components
- Phase 2: Create CSS-only base components
- Phase 3: Rebuild React components using tokens
- Phase 4: Build Vue components using same token foundation

This ensures design consistency while supporting both frameworks.""",

Excellent strategic question. Let me analyze our competitive landscape...

**Competitive Analysis Framework**:

**Figma's Strengths**:
- Design-to-code automation
- Real-time collaboration
- Developer handoff tools
- Market momentum

**Our Differentiation Opportunities**:
1. **Enterprise Integration**: Deep integration with existing development workflows
2. **Customization Depth**: Configurable design systems vs. Figma's standardized approach
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimized for large-scale enterprise applications
4. **Security & Compliance**: Enterprise-grade security that Figma lacks

**Strategic Response**:
- **Short-term**: Emphasize enterprise security and integration advantages
- **Medium-term**: Develop superior design system management capabilities
- **Long-term**: Build AI-powered design optimization that goes beyond Figma's automation
