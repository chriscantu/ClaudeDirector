Weekly Reporter Chat Integration - Personal Retrospective Focus
Extends existing weekly_reporter.py with chat interface for personal reflection

üèóÔ∏è Martin | Platform Architecture - SOLID/DRY compliance
üéØ EXTENDS existing weekly_reporter.py (DRY compliance)
üîí PERSONAL FOCUS: Individual reflection, not business intelligence

SEQUENTIAL THINKING METHODOLOGY APPLIED:
1. Problem Definition: Add chat interface to existing weekly reporter
2. Current State Analysis: weekly_reporter.py provides core functionality
3. Solution Hypothesis: Extension pattern with conversational layer for personal use
4. Validation: Context7 Lightweight Fallback + Protocol interfaces
5. Execution: Simple chat command routing for personal retrospectives
6. Verification: DRY compliance + personal focus validation

CONTEXT7 PATTERNS IMPLEMENTED:
- Extension Pattern: Builds on existing weekly_reporter.py infrastructure
- Adapter Pattern: Chat interface adapts existing report generation
- Command Pattern: Chat commands route to personal retrospective logic
- Lightweight Fallback: Graceful degradation when dependencies unavailable

BLOAT_PREVENTION: Extends existing infrastructure, no duplication
PROJECT_STRUCTURE: Located in .claudedirector/lib/reporting/ (compliant)
PERSONAL FOCUS: Individual reflection only - no business intelligence
