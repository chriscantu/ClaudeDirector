ðŸš¨ BASE ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK
Foundation classes for Real-Time Development Process Enforcement System

SOLID Principles Applied:
- Single Responsibility: Each class has one specific enforcement concern
- Open/Closed: Extensible through abstract interfaces, closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution: All enforcement gates implement common interface
- Interface Segregation: Separate interfaces for different enforcement concerns
- Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations

DRY Principle Applied:
- Single source of truth for enforcement patterns
- Reusable base classes eliminate duplication
- Common validation logic centralized
