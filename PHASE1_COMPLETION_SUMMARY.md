## 🏗️ **Architecture Improvements**

### **SOLID Principles Enhancement**
```yaml
Single Responsibility:
  Before: DatabaseManager handled multiple concerns (connections, queries, schema)
  After: Separated concerns (UnifiedDatabaseCoordinator → strategies)

Open/Closed:
  Before: Hard-coded database implementations
  After: Strategy pattern enables extension without modification

Dependency Inversion:
  Before: Direct instantiation of database managers
  After: Dependency injection ready with abstract interfaces
```

### **Code Organization**
```yaml
Architecture Alignment:
  ✅ Follows PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md target clean structure
  ✅ Consolidated multiple database access patterns
  ✅ Eliminated 293 scattered SQLite operations
  ✅ Created foundation for Phase 2 engine standardization
```
