# Phase 9.5: Strategic Intelligence Consolidation - DRAFT

## Status: DRAFT PR - Planning Phase

This PR will implement Phase 9.5: Strategic Intelligence Consolidation as specified in:
- \`docs/phases/009-architecture-evolution/phase9.5-strategic-intelligence-consolidation-spec.md\`
- \`docs/phases/009-architecture-evolution/phase9.5-implementation-plan.md\`
- \`docs/phases/009-architecture-evolution/phase9.5-task-tracker.md\`

## Key Goals
- 📦 **Eliminate 2,328 lines** of undocumented strategic intelligence code
- 🏗️ **Migrate functionality** into existing \`ai_intelligence\` and \`context_engineering\` modules
- 📋 **Achieve 100% architectural compliance** with documented structure
- ✅ **Maintain 39/39 P0 tests** passing throughout migration
- 🧹 **Apply Sequential Thinking** to comprehensive .claudedirector directory audit

## Implementation Approach
Using Sequential Thinking methodology for systematic consolidation while preserving valuable functionality and maintaining system integrity.
