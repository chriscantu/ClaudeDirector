## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As an engineering leader**, I want ClaudeDirector to proactively identify strategic opportunities and risks before they become critical, so that I can make informed decisions with predictive intelligence rather than reactive analysis.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a strategic decision context (team restructuring, technology adoption, budget allocation), **When** I engage ClaudeDirector, **Then** it provides predictive analysis with confidence scores, risk assessment, and proactive recommendations based on similar organizational patterns.

2. **Given** ongoing strategic initiatives across multiple quarters, **When** ClaudeDirector analyzes organizational patterns, **Then** it proactively surfaces potential issues, opportunities, and strategic adjustments before they become critical.

3. **Given** executive stakeholder meetings and board presentations, **When** I need strategic intelligence, **Then** ClaudeDirector provides data-driven insights with framework attribution, ROI projections, and measurable success criteria.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when ML models have low confidence in predictions?
- How does system handle conflicting strategic frameworks or recommendations?
- What occurs when organizational context changes rapidly (acquisitions, pivots)?
- How does system maintain accuracy with limited historical strategic data?
