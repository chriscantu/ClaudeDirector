**Questions for SLT Discussion:**
1. **Market expansion timeline:** Should we accelerate internationalization hiring to capture Q4 European market opportunity, or maintain current timeline for Q1 2025?
2. **Security integration priority:** Can Security team provide dedicated 2-week allocation for authentication V2, or should we adjust timeline and communicate impact to consuming teams?
3. **Platform investment ROI:** Given 340% ROI demonstrated, should we increase platform investment budget for Q4 to accelerate competitive advantage initiatives?
