# Strategic Template Foundation

**Template Version**: 1.0 | **Constitutional Compliance**: Active | **Bloat Prevention**: Enforced

---

## 🎯 **Constitutional Requirements** (Shared Across All Templates)

### **Simplicity Constraints**
- **Project Count**: Maximum 3 projects per specification
- **Component Count**: Maximum 5 components per project
- **Complexity Justification**: Required for any violations
- **Architectural Debt**: Must be tracked and justified

### **Methodology Enforcement**
- **Sequential Thinking**: Mandatory 6-step methodology
- **Test-Driven Development**: RED-GREEN-Refactor workflow
- **Spec-Kit Format**: Executable specification structure
- **P0 Testing**: Zero tolerance for failures

### **Quality Standards**
- **DRY Principle**: Zero code duplication
- **SOLID Principles**: Architectural compliance
- **Bloat Prevention**: Net reduction per commit
- **Performance**: <200ms response time

### **Architectural Compliance**
- **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**: Must follow established directory structure
- **BLOAT_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md**: Must prevent code duplication
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Must configure bloat prevention validation
- **Single Source of Truth**: Must avoid duplication across templates

## 🏗️ **Component Design Pattern** (DRY Compliance)

### **Standard Component Structure**
```yaml
Component:
  purpose: "[What this component does]"
  responsibilities: "[Specific responsibilities]"
  location: ".claudedirector/lib/[module]/[component].py"
  interfaces: "[How it interacts with other components]"
  constitutional_compliance: "[How it meets simplicity constraints]"
  bloat_prevention: "[How this avoids duplication]"
```

### **Required Module Locations**
- **Core Components**: `.claudedirector/lib/core/`
- **AI Intelligence**: `.claudedirector/lib/ai_intelligence/`
- **Context Engineering**: `.claudedirector/lib/context_engineering/`
- **P0 Features**: `.claudedirector/lib/p0_features/`
- **Integration**: `.claudedirector/lib/integration/`

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy Pattern** (DRY Compliance)

### **P0 Tests** (Zero Tolerance)
- **Critical Functionality**: Core business logic validation
- **Performance Requirements**: <200ms response time
- **Security Requirements**: Data protection validation
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Simplicity constraint validation

### **Unit Tests**
- **Component Isolation**: Individual component testing
- **Business Logic**: Core functionality validation
- **Integration**: Cross-component interaction testing
- **DRY/SOLID Compliance**: Architectural principle validation

### **Strategic Validation Tests**
- **Framework Application**: Strategic framework utilization
- **Executive Criteria**: Board-ready validation
- **Business Impact**: ROI and competitive advantage
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation validation

---

## 📈 **Success Metrics Pattern** (DRY Compliance)

### **Technical Metrics**
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, resource usage
- **Quality**: Bug rate, technical debt ratio, code coverage
- **Reliability**: Uptime, error rate, recovery time
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Simplicity and methodology adherence

### **Business Metrics**
- **ROI**: Return on investment calculation
- **User Adoption**: Usage metrics, user satisfaction
- **Market Impact**: Competitive advantage, market position
- **Strategic Value**: Framework application and executive readiness

### **Development Metrics**
- **Code Quality**: DRY/SOLID compliance, technical debt
- **Testing Coverage**: P0 test coverage, unit test coverage
- **Bloat Prevention**: Net line reduction, duplication elimination
- **Methodology Adherence**: Sequential Thinking application

**Constitutional Enforcement**: All templates must pass constitutional compliance checks before implementation can begin. All violations will block development until resolved.

**Bloat Prevention**: This foundation template eliminates duplication across spec/plan/tasks templates, ensuring DRY principle compliance.

**Architectural Alignment**: All templates must align with PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md and BLOAT_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md requirements.
