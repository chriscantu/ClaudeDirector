# ADR-002: Code Quality & SOLID Principles Refactoring

**Status**: In Progress  
**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Authors**: Martin (Principal Platform Architect)  
**Reviewers**: Berny (AI/ML Engineer), Delbert (Data Engineer)

## Context

Initial P0 AI implementation by Berny contains several architectural violations that compromise maintainability, extensibility, and adherence to engineering principles:

### **Critical Issues Identified**

**DRY Violations**:
- 67+ hard-coded strings (thresholds, weights, recommendations)
- Duplicate validation logic across AI engines
- Repeated performance monitoring patterns
- Copy-paste test fixture patterns

**SOLID Principle Violations**:
- **SRP**: AI engines mixing inference, validation, performance monitoring
- **OCP**: Hard-coded thresholds prevent extension without modification  
- **LSP**: Inconsistent interfaces between Decision/Health engines
- **ISP**: Monolithic base classes with unused methods
- **DIP**: Direct dependencies on concrete implementations

**Architectural Structure Issues**:
- `p0_features/` lacks functional domain grouping
- Missing clear bounded contexts
- Shared components mixed with feature-specific logic

## Decision

Implement comprehensive refactoring following Domain-Driven Design and SOLID principles:

### **1. Configuration Centralization**
- Extract all hard-coded values to declarative configuration
- Use Pydantic models for type safety and validation
- Environment-aware configuration (dev/test/prod)

### **2. Domain-Driven P0 Structure**
```
lib/claudedirector/p0_features/
├── domains/
│   ├── decision_intelligence/     # Decision detection & lifecycle
│   ├── health_assessment/         # Initiative health & risk prediction  
│   └── strategic_insights/        # Pattern recognition & recommendations
├── shared/
│   ├── ai_core/                   # AI abstractions & interfaces
│   ├── data_access/              # Database abstractions
│   └── infrastructure/           # Cross-cutting concerns
└── integration/                  # Domain orchestration & APIs
```

### **3. SOLID Compliance**
- **SRP**: Separate inference, validation, monitoring responsibilities
- **OCP**: Plugin architecture for extensible AI models
- **LSP**: Consistent interfaces across all AI engines
- **ISP**: Segregated interfaces (IInferenceEngine, IValidator, IMonitor)
- **DIP**: Dependency injection for all external dependencies

### **4. Configuration-Driven Architecture**
- Declarative model definitions (YAML/JSON)
- Runtime model swapping without code changes
- A/B testing support for AI model variants

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Configuration Centralization** ⏳
1. Extract hard-coded constants to config classes
2. Create Pydantic configuration models
3. Implement configuration validation

### **Phase 2: Interface Segregation** 
1. Define minimal, focused interfaces
2. Separate inference from validation/monitoring
3. Create abstract base implementations

### **Phase 3: Domain Structure**
1. Reorganize by business capability
2. Establish clear bounded contexts
3. Define domain service interfaces

### **Phase 4: Dependency Injection**
1. Remove direct instantiation
2. Implement container-based DI
3. Enable configuration-driven composition

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Maintainability**: 60% reduction in code duplication
- **Extensibility**: New AI models via configuration only
- **Testability**: Isolated testing of each responsibility
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and optimized composition

### **Negative**  
- **Complexity**: More files and abstractions initially
- **Migration**: Existing tests need updates
- **Learning**: Team needs DDD/SOLID training

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Incremental migration preserving existing APIs
- Comprehensive test coverage during refactoring
- Documentation and training for new patterns

## Validation Criteria

### **DRY Compliance**
- [ ] Zero duplicate constants across codebase
- [ ] Shared validation logic in single location
- [ ] Configuration-driven behavior changes

### **SOLID Compliance**  
- [ ] Each class has single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] Extension without modification of existing code
- [ ] Consistent interfaces across similar components
- [ ] Client-specific interfaces (no fat interfaces)
- [ ] Zero direct dependencies on concrete classes

### **Domain Architecture**
- [ ] Clear business capability grouping
- [ ] Minimal coupling between domains
- [ ] Explicit domain service interfaces

### **Performance**
- [ ] No degradation in AI inference performance
- [ ] <5% overhead from additional abstractions
- [ ] Maintained <200ms SLA compliance

## Implementation Notes

**Breaking Changes**: Minimal - existing public APIs preserved  
**Migration Path**: Feature flag controlled rollout  
**Timeline**: 2 sprints (configuration + interfaces)  
**Dependencies**: None - purely internal refactoring
