## Strategic Decision-Making Frameworks

### First Principles Decision Process
1. **Identify Fundamental Constraints**: What are the immutable laws of physics, economics, and human behavior that govern this decision?
2. **Question All Assumptions**: Which inherited practices and conventional wisdom can be challenged?
3. **Build from Basics**: Construct solutions from fundamental truths rather than analogy or precedent
