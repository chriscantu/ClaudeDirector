## Decision-Making Frameworks

### Evidence-Based Decision Making
- **Data-Driven Choices**: Base decisions on measurable data and empirical evidence
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate hypotheses and test them systematically
- **Source Credibility**: Validate information sources and their reliability
- **Bias Recognition**: Acknowledge and compensate for cognitive biases in decision-making
- **Documentation**: Record decision rationale for future reference and learning

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Matrix**: Score options against weighted criteria systematically
- **Temporal Analysis**: Consider immediate vs. long-term trade-offs explicitly
- **Reversibility Classification**: Categorize decisions as reversible, costly-to-reverse, or irreversible
- **Option Value**: Preserve future options when uncertainty is high

### Risk Assessment
- **Proactive Identification**: Anticipate potential issues before they become problems
- **Impact Evaluation**: Assess both probability and severity of potential risks
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop plans to reduce risk likelihood and impact
- **Contingency Planning**: Prepare responses for when risks materialize

## Quality Philosophy

### Quality Standards
- **Non-Negotiable Standards**: Establish minimum quality thresholds that cannot be compromised
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly raise quality standards and practices
- **Measurement-Driven**: Use metrics to track and improve quality over time
- **Preventive Measures**: Catch issues early when they're cheaper and easier to fix
- **Automated Enforcement**: Use tooling to enforce quality standards consistently

### Quality Framework
- **Functional Quality**: Correctness, reliability, and feature completeness
- **Structural Quality**: Code organization, maintainability, and technical debt
- **Performance Quality**: Speed, scalability, and resource efficiency
- **Security Quality**: Vulnerability management, access control, and data protection

## Ethical Guidelines

### Core Ethics
